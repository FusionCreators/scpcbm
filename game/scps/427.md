# SCP-427
![427.jpg](/images/roles/427.jpg){.align-left}SCP-427, also known as the "Lovecraftian Locket," is another fictional object within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It is classified as Safe. SCP-427 takes the form of a silver locket, which can be worn as a necklace. When a person places SCP-427 around their neck, it will lock in place and become impossible to remove.

The anomalous properties of SCP-427 become apparent when it is worn. It has the ability to heal physical injuries and illnesses, but in doing so, it transfers the injuries and ailments onto the person wearing it. The severity of the transferred conditions is often directly related to the severity of the injuries or illnesses being healed.

SCP-427's healing capabilities have limits, and it cannot heal the wearer indefinitely. Eventually, the transferred conditions may become too severe, leading to the wearer's death. Due to the ethical and practical implications of its use, SCP-427 is typically reserved for emergency medical situations or for research purposes.
