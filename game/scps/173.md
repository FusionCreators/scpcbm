**SCP-173** is *a fictional entity and one of the most well-known and iconic objects (or SCPs) in the SCP Foundation's collaborative creative writing project. The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization that, in this context, is responsible for identifying, capturing, and containing anomalous and often dangerous objects and entities.*


**Special Containment Procedures:**
**SCP-173** is *to be kept in a locked container at all times. When personnel enter the containment chamber, they must remain at least 5 meters (16 feet) away from SCP-173 at all times. Two persons must maintain direct eye contact with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.*

**Description:**
**SCP-173** *is a humanoid statue composed of concrete and rebar. It is approximately 2 meters (6.5 feet) tall and exhibits signs of significant damage and wear. It is animate and extremely hostile. SCP-173 is known for its ability to move at incredibly high speeds when not in direct line of sight.*

*The primary anomaly associated with* **SCP-173** *is that it becomes highly aggressive when not observed. If personnel break eye contact with* **SCP-173**, *it will quickly move towards them and attack, typically snapping the neck of its victim. However, when it is observed*, **SCP-173** *remains immobile. This has led to containment procedures requiring constant surveillance.*

**SCP-173** *has led to the development of the well-known phrase within the SCP Foundation: "The Statue" or "The Sculpture." To prevent containment breaches and harm to personnel, multiple individuals must maintain direct eye contact while in its presence.*

**SCP-173's origin** and the reason for its behavior are largely unknown, *and its containment procedures are designed to ensure that it is always observed by at least two individuals. Its mysterious and lethal nature is part of what makes **SCP-173** a memorable and iconic entity within the **SCP Foundation's** extensive lore.*
