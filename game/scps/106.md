**SCP-106**, also known as "The Old Man" or "The Radical Larry," 
*is a fictional character within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It is one of the more disturbing and dangerous entities contained by the SCP Foundation.*

Here are some key characteristics and behaviors of **SCP-106**:

**Appearance**: SCP-106 is described as an elderly and decrepit humanoid, *often appearing as a gaunt, elderly man. Its skin is rotting and decaying, giving it a grotesque and unsettling appearance.*

**Phasing Abilities**: SCP-106 possesses the ability to "phase" through solid matter, *allowing it to move through walls and other obstacles. It can use this ability for both escape and offensive purposes.*

**Sadistic Behavior**: SCP-106 is known for its sadistic and predatory behavior. *It actively seeks out humans and other living creatures to capture and torment. It takes pleasure in causing extreme physical and psychological suffering to its victims.*

`Corrosive Secretion: SCP-106 emits a highly corrosive black substance from its body, which it uses to corrode surfaces and incapacitate its prey. This secretion can also slow down the decomposition of SCP-106's own body.`

**Pocket Dimension**: SCP-106 can create a pocket dimension, known as its "pocket universe," which it uses to imprison its victims. *This dimension is a dark, labyrinthine realm filled with hazards and traps, making escape nearly impossible.*

**High Regeneration**: SCP-106 displays an exceptional regenerative ability, allowing it to heal from injuries quickly. *This makes containment and neutralization extremely challenging.*

The **SCP Foundation** works diligently to keep SCP-106 contained in a specially designed cell to prevent its escape and minimize its interaction with humans. *The cell is lined with a substance to resist SCP-106's corrosive secretion, and containment procedures are in place to prevent its breach.*

**SCP-106** is considered one of the more dangerous SCPs due to its malicious nature, *sadistic tendencies, and the difficulty of containing it effectively. It is a prominent figure in the SCP Foundation's lore and has been featured in various forms of SCP-related media, including stories, art, and video games.*
