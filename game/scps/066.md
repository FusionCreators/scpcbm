# SCP-066
![66.webp](/images/roles/66.webp){.align-left}SCP-066, also known as "Eric's Toy," is a fictional object within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It is a small, anomalous wind-up toy.

Key characteristics and behaviors of SCP-066 include:

Appearance: SCP-066 is a small wind-up toy in the shape of a green tortoise with a red shell. When wound up, it plays a classical piano piece.

Musical Anomaly: When SCP-066 is wound up and allowed to play its music, it generates a series of anomalous effects. These effects typically cause unpredictable and sometimes bizarre occurrences, such as the spontaneous appearance of confetti, the levitation of objects, or even the transformation of individuals into various objects, animals, or even abstract concepts.

Musical Manipulation: The type and scale of anomalous events produced by SCP-066 seem to be influenced by the tune that SCP-066 plays. By changing the melody, it's possible to alter the nature of the anomalies.

Safe-Class Object: SCP-066 is classified as "Safe" and is generally harmless as long as it is handled with care and its anomalous properties are understood and controlled.

Containment: SCP-066 is stored in a standard containment locker when not in use. Experimentation with SCP-066 is permitted, but safety precautions must be observed.

SCP-066 is known for its whimsical and unpredictable nature. Its ability to generate a wide range of anomalous effects through music makes it a unique and entertaining object within the SCP Foundation's universe. Researchers use it for experimentation and exploration of its musical anomalies, often resulting in humorous and peculiar outcomes.
