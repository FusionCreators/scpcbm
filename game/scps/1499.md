**SCP-1499**, also known as "The Gas Mask," is a fictional object within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project, *is an anomalous gas mask with peculiar properties.*

**Description**:
**SCP-1499** appears to be an ordinary Soviet GP-5 gas mask. However, *it exhibits several anomalous properties. The primary anomaly is related to the mask's ability to transport individuals to an alternate dimension when worn.*

**Anomalous Effects**:
When a person dons **SCP-1499**, they are transported to an alternate reality designated as **SCP-1499-1**. *This alternate dimension is a bleak and desolate landscape, reminiscent of a post-apocalyptic environment. In **SCP-1499-1**, the air is filled with an unidentified corrosive and toxic gas. Despite the inhospitable conditions, the wearer of the mask is immune to the effects of the gas and can explore the dimension freely.*

**Exploration**:
**SCP-1499-1** contains various anomalous entities and objects. *Some of these entities may be hostile, while others are non-hostile or even helpful. Explorations of **SCP-1499-1** have revealed a wide range of locations and scenarios, from abandoned cities to mysterious landscapes.*

*Duration*:
The amount of time an individual can spend in **SCP-1499-1** is limited by the remaining air supply in the gas mask. *Once the filter is exhausted, the mask will automatically transport the wearer back to their original location. Individuals may exit **SCP-1499-1** by removing the mask, but they will then find themselves back in their original reality.*

**Containment**:
**SCP-1499** is to be stored in a standard containment locker at **Site-19**. *Access to the gas mask is restricted, and experimentation with it requires Level 2 clearance. Due to its Safe classification, **SCP-1499** is considered non-hostile, and personnel are allowed to explore **SCP-1499-1** under controlled conditions.*

The narrative surrounding **SCP-1499** often explores the eerie and mysterious alternate dimension it creates, *as well as the potential dangers and opportunities it presents. The gas mask's use for exploration and its interaction with other anomalies add depth to its storyline within the SCP Foundation's universe.*
