# SCP-012
![scp-012.webp](/images/roles/scp-012.webp){.align-left}SCP-012, also known as "A Bad Composition," is a fictional object in the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It is a unique and dangerous anomalous item with a strong focus on storytelling and narrative elements. Here's a summary of its lore:

The Object: SCP-012 is a piece of sheet music, handwritten in black ink on aged parchment. The music itself is described as an unsettling and discordant composition that evokes strong negative emotions in those who listen to it or attempt to perform it.

Effects: When someone attempts to play SCP-012, they become compelled to complete the entire piece, even if they are not skilled musicians. During this process, they become increasingly obsessed and frenzied, often neglecting their own well-being to finish the performance.

Emotional Influence: SCP-012 is known to exert a powerful emotional influence on individuals, causing them to feel overwhelming dread, sadness, and despair. This influence can lead to self-harm, suicide, or violent behavior directed at others.

Recovery: SCP-012 was initially found in the possession of a talented composer who had died by suicide. The piece had been written in his own blood.

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-012 is contained within a protective glass case with thick walls to minimize its effects on personnel. Access is restricted to Level 3 personnel or higher, and any personnel exposed to SCP-012 must undergo psychological evaluation and monitoring.

The lore of SCP-012 is notable for its focus on the emotional and psychological effects it has on those who encounter it. It serves as an example of how the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project explores the impact of anomalous objects on individuals and the measures taken to contain and study them. Additionally, the narrative elements of SCP-012 highlight the way the SCP Foundation uncovers the history and context of these anomalous items.
