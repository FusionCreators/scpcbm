# SCP-1025
![1025.webp](/images/roles/1025.webp){.align-left}SCP-1025, also known as "Encyclopedia of Diseases," is a fictional entry within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It is classified as Safe. SCP-1025 is an anomalous book that contains descriptions of various diseases, along with their symptoms, progression, and methods of treatment.

Description:
SCP-1025 is a hardcover book with no visible title or author. It is written in an unknown script and is not bound by ordinary means. The anomalous properties of SCP-1025 become apparent when an individual reads the book. If a person reads the description of a disease within SCP-1025, they will invariably develop the symptoms of that disease within a few days.

The book contains entries on a wide range of diseases, both known and unknown to medical science. It has led to the discovery of new diseases and medical conditions that were previously undocumented. The effects of reading SCP-1025 can be fatal, depending on the disease described.

Containment:
SCP-1025 is stored within a locked case in a secure containment chamber at the SCP Foundation. Access to the book is restricted, and all testing involving SCP-1025 must be approved by the Site Director.

Use and Caution:
SCP-1025 is not used for medical research due to its dangerous effects. It is considered valuable for containment and quarantine procedures, as reading descriptions of infectious diseases can help medical personnel recognize and treat them.

SCP-1025 serves as a reminder of the unpredictable and potentially lethal nature of anomalous objects within the SCP Foundation universe. It also highlights the caution with which the Foundation must approach such objects to prevent harm and contain potential threats.
