![049.png](/images/roles/049.png){.align-left}SCP-049, known as the "Plague Doctor," is another fictional entity within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. This particular SCP is described as a humanoid entity resembling a medieval plague doctor, complete with a long, dark robe and a mask. SCP-049's appearance is unsettling and eerie, but its anomalous properties go beyond its appearance.

Key features and characteristics of SCP-049 include:

Medical Knowledge: SCP-049 appears to have an advanced understanding of medicine, particularly from a 16th-century perspective. It believes that a "pestilence" is affecting individuals and is obsessed with "curing" them.

"Treatment": When SCP-049 encounters a person, it will typically attempt to anesthetize them and then perform a series of surgical procedures, usually resulting in the death of the subject. SCP-049 believes that it is "curing" people of the pestilence that it claims afflicts them.

Reanimation: After performing its surgical procedures, SCP-049 will use an unknown method to reanimate the corpse, turning it into a zombie-like entity referred to as SCP-049-2. These reanimated creatures are loyal to SCP-049 and will follow its commands.

Infectious Touch: SCP-049's touch can transmit an anomalous contagion, causing the person to succumb to its effects over time.

Sentience: SCP-049 appears to be sentient and capable of communication, often expressing its concern about the "pestilence" that it perceives in people.

The SCP-049 article explores the character's motivations and actions, highlighting its obsession with curing what it believes is a disease. The SCP Foundation contains and studies SCP-049, trying to understand its origins and the nature of the "pestilence" it references.

As with other SCPs, SCP-049 has gained popularity in various creative works, including fan fiction, art, and video games, contributing to the rich and expansive fictional universe of the SCP Foundation.
