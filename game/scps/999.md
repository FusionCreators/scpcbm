SCP-999, also known as "The Tickle Monster," is a Safe-class anomaly in the SCP Foundation universe. It's a large, amorphous, orange blob that exhibits highly benevolent and playful behavior. SCP-999's primary anomalous property is its ability to make anyone it comes into contact with feel incredibly happy and euphoric.

The creature is known for its friendliness, and it enjoys engaging in playful activities with Foundation personnel. It's particularly fond of tickling and physical contact. SCP-999's touch has been observed to alleviate stress, anxiety, and even heal minor injuries in those it interacts with.

Despite its playful nature, SCP-999 is also highly obedient to the Foundation's commands and understands containment protocols. It's often used for therapeutic purposes and morale-boosting among Foundation personnel.
