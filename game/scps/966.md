# SCP-966
![966.png](/images/roles/966.png){.align-left}SCP-966, also known as "Sleep Killers," is a fictional entity within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. These creatures are nocturnal, predatory beings with several anomalous properties.

Key characteristics and behaviors of SCP-966 include:

Appearance: SCP-966 are described as hairless, quadrupedal creatures, roughly 1.4 meters in length. They have long, spindly limbs and are completely lacking in eyes or visible facial features.

Nocturnal Behavior: SCP-966 are primarily active during the nighttime, and they are known to emit a low-level, long-wave sound that causes extreme fatigue and disorientation in those who hear it. This makes it difficult for victims to stay awake or be aware of the creatures' presence.

Aggressive Predators: SCP-966 are carnivorous and will actively hunt and attack humans or animals during their nocturnal activities. They work in groups and display coordinated predatory behavior, including flanking and surrounding their prey.

Near-Invisibility: SCP-966 do not have any external eyes or visible sensory organs. Instead, they are thought to perceive their environment through some form of sensory perception that is not yet fully understood. This makes them difficult to detect.

Mysterious Origins: The origins of SCP-966 are not well-understood, and it is unclear where they came from. They are typically discovered in rural or remote areas, where they have been responsible for unexplained deaths and disappearances.

To contain SCP-966, the Foundation has established special procedures and containment cells to limit their nocturnal activity. These procedures include soundproofing the containment area and minimizing light exposure to keep the creatures docile during the daytime.

SCP-966 is a dangerous and enigmatic entity within the SCP Foundation's fictional universe. It is featured in various SCP-related media, including stories and games, adding to the overall lore and mythology of the SCP Foundation.
