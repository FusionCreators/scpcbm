# SCP-1162
![1162.webp](/images/roles/1162.webp){.align-left}SCP-1162, also known as the "Hole to Another Place," is a fictional object within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It is classified as Safe. SCP-1162 is a small hole that leads to an unknown and potentially alternate location.

Description:
SCP-1162 is a simple, dark hole in a concrete wall, measuring approximately 10 centimeters in diameter. The hole appears bottomless, and any objects or substances inserted into it will disappear entirely. The nature of where these objects or substances go is not fully understood.

Properties:

Objects placed inside SCP-1162 appear to be lost forever. The nature of the hole's destination is unknown, and there is no way to retrieve the objects once they have been inserted.
SCP-1162 has a peculiar characteristic in that it seems to know what a person desires or needs at the moment of insertion. If an individual inserts their hand or arm into the hole, SCP-1162 may provide them with an object or substance that could be beneficial or harmful, depending on the person's intentions and desires.
Containment:
SCP-1162 is contained within a standard containment chamber at Site-19. The hole is sealed with a concrete cover, and access to it is restricted. Experimentation with SCP-1162 is allowed but requires Level 2 clearance.

The SCP Foundation is cautious about experimenting with SCP-1162, as its unpredictable nature makes it challenging to control. The potential for both helpful and harmful outcomes makes it a unique and potentially dangerous anomaly within the Foundation's universe.

SCP-1162's narrative often explores the moral and ethical dilemmas that arise when individuals interact with the anomaly, as well as the mysteries surrounding its origin and the nature of the place it connects to.
