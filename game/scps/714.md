# SCP-714
![scp-714.webp](/images/items/scp-714.webp){.align-left}In the game, SCP-714 functions similarly to its description in the original SCP Foundation lore. When the player character picks up and wears SCP-714, they gain the following benefits:

Reduced Sensation: SCP-714 reduces the player character's sensitivity to damage, making them more resistant to harm. This means they can survive longer in dangerous situations.

Reduced Sleep Requirement: SCP-714 allows the player character to go without sleep for extended periods, which can be particularly useful in a game where navigating the facility and avoiding SCPs is crucial to survival.

It's important to note that while SCP-714 offers these advantages, there are drawbacks as well. The reduced sensation can make it difficult for the player to gauge their health, and the reduced emotional response can make interactions with other characters in the game more challenging.
