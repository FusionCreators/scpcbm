# SCP-500
![500.png](/images/items/500.png =200x){.align-right}**Name**: `SCP-500-01`
**Category**: `CONSUMABLE`

[SCP-500](/en/game/scps/500) is a consumable item that can be found in the [Maintenance Tunnels](/en/game/rooms/106chamb) and the storage room at [SCP-035](/en/game/scps/035)'s [containment chamber](/en/game/rooms/035) in the [Heavy Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/hcz). When the player uses this item, a message will pop up saying: "You swallowed the pill." Using this item will cure the player from [SCP-008](/en/game/rooms/008), all diseases obtained via [SCP-1025](/en/game/scps/1025), [SCP-966](/en/game/scps/966)'s harmful effects, completely refill their stamina, heal them completely and add 200HP to their maximum health. It is important to note that, in singleplayer or co-op, this item will **not** heal the player's injuries and decrease their blood loss.

**Category**: `CONSUMABLE`

The Upgraded Pill is a consumable item that can be made by putting SCP-500-01 inside of [SCP-914 "The Clockworks"](/en/game/scps/914) on the setting 'Very Fine". Using this pill will have the same effects as using SCP-427 for too long, the only difference being it is sped up and the player dies in 1 minute.

# SCP-427
**Name**: `SCP-427`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`

SCP-427 is an equippable item that can be made by putting SCP-500-01 or the Upgraded Pill inside of [SCP-914 "The Clockworks"](/en/game/scps/914) on the setting "Fine". When the player equips it, a message will appear saying: "You opened the locked." While this item is equipped, it will slowly decrease the player's injuries and blood loss. The following sounds can be heard repeatedly coming from the item while equipped:

If the player opens the locket, they will die after 7 minutes and the following messages will appear in order:

> You feel refreshed and energetic.

>You feel gentle muscle spasms all over your body.

>Your muscles are swelling. You feel more powerful than ever.

After this message the player will start producing the following decal:

>You can't feel your legs. But you don't need legs anymore.

After the last message, the player will be unable to stand up and dies shortly after.
