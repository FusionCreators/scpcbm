[SCP-500-01](/en/game/scps/500) is a consumable item that can be found in the [Maintenance Tunnels](/en/game/rooms/106chamb) and the storage room at [SCP-035](/en/game/scps/035)'s [containment chamber](/en/game/rooms/035) in the [Heavy Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/hcz). When the player uses this item, a message will pop up saying: "You swallowed the pill." Using this item will cure the player from [SCP-008](/en/game/rooms/008), all diseases obtained via [SCP-1025](/en/game/scps/1025), [SCP-966](/en/game/scps/966)'s harmful effects, completely refill their stamina, heal them completely and add 200HP to their maximum health. It is important to note that, in singleplayer or co-op, this item will **not** heal the player's injuries and decrease their blood loss.
