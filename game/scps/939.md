**SCP-939**, also known as "With Many Voices," are a group of predatory, *nocturnal creatures featured in the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. They are potential danger to humans and their anomalous abilities.*

**Description**:
**SCP-939** are biological entities that resemble large, reptilian canids (dogs or wolves) but possess some unique and disturbing characteristics. *They are completely blind, but they have evolved to hunt through acute sense of hearing. SCP-939 have no eyes, and their skin is translucent, allowing for visual identification of their skeletal structure. Their most striking feature is their ability to mimic human speech and other sounds, enabling them to deceive and lure potential prey.*

**Abilities**:

**Mimicry**: SCP-939 can imitate human voices and other sounds they have heard. *This makes them highly effective at luring potential victims into their vicinity by calling for help or mimicking the voices of loved ones.*

**Hunting**: They use their keen hearing and mimicry abilities to locate and hunt prey. *Once close to their target, SCP-939 will incapacitate it, typically by biting and injecting a sedative toxin, before consuming it.*

**Pack Behavior**: SCP-939 are known to work together in hunting and will communicate with one another using their vocal mimicry. *They also appear to have a social structure within their packs.*

**Containment**:
**SCP-939** are contained within a specialized containment unit designed to prevent them from using their mimicry abilities to manipulate personnel. *All interactions with SCP-939 are to be conducted via written communication or monitored audio-visual feeds. Access to their containment area is restricted.*

**Additional Information**:
The lore and containment procedures for **SCP-939** can vary between different tales and adaptations within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing community. *They are often depicted as highly intelligent and dangerous creatures that pose a significant challenge to containment and study.*
