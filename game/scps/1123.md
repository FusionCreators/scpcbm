**SCP-1123**, also known as "Atrocity Skull," is a fictional object within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. *SCP-1123 is an anomalous human skull with a dark and disturbing history.*

**Description**:
**SCP-1123** is a human skull of unknown origin. It exhibits no signs of abnormality when subjected to conventional analysis. However, *its anomalous properties become evident when a person touches the skull while having an emotional response, particularly when experiencing strong negative emotions, such as fear, sorrow, or anger.*

**Anomalous Effects**:
When touched by a person experiencing a strong negative emotional response, **SCP-1123** triggers vivid and disturbing hallucinations in the affected individual. *These hallucinations are typically related to the negative emotions being felt at the time of contact and are often traumatic or horrifying in nature.*

**Hallucinations**:
The hallucinations experienced are highly detailed and often involve violent or gruesome scenes. *Subjects report vivid sensations, such as physical pain or emotional distress, during these hallucinations. The experiences can be so traumatizing that they may leave lasting psychological scars.*

**History** and **Discovery**:
The skull was initially discovered in the home of a deceased serial killer and was associated with several unsolved murders. *Its connection to the killer and the gruesome nature of the hallucinations it induces have contributed to its classification as an SCP.*

**Containment**:
**SCP-1123** is to be stored in a locked, opaque container to prevent accidental contact and is kept in a secure containment vault at Site-19. *Access to SCP-1123 is restricted, and researchers are required to obtain Level 3 clearance for experimentation.*

**SCP-1123** is a prime example of how the SCP Foundation's fictional universe contains objects that tap into deeply unsettling and disturbing elements. *Its ability to elicit traumatic hallucinations tied to strong negative emotions adds to the eerie nature of the SCP.*
