# SCP-372
![372.jpg](/images/roles/372.jpg){.align-left}SCP-372, also known as "The Peripheral Jumper," is a fictional entity within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It was classified as Euclid by the Foundation, and its primary anomalous property is its ability to appear on the periphery of a person's vision. SCP-372 is described as being vaguely insectoid in appearance and is known for following people and observing them. When someone attempts to look directly at SCP-372, it will instantly vanish from their line of sight.

SCP-372 is often used in SCP Foundation fiction to create a sense of paranoia and unease, as it is always there, just out of sight. While it is generally considered harmless, it can cause psychological distress to those who are aware of its presence.
