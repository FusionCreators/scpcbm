**SCP-372**, also known as "The Peripheral Jumper," is a fictional entity within the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project, *its primary anomalous property is its ability to appear on the periphery of a person's vision. SCP-372 is described as being vaguely insectoid in appearance and is known for following people and observing them. When someone attempts to look directly at **SCP-372**, it will instantly vanish from their line of sight.*

**SCP-372** is often used in SCP Foundation fiction to create a sense of paranoia and unease, *as it is always there, just out of sight. While it is generally considered harmless, it can cause psychological distress to those who are aware of its presence.*
