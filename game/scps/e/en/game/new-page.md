SCP-096, also known as "The Shy Guy," is a fictional character from the collaborative creative writing project known as the SCP Foundation. The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization that catalogues and contains anomalous entities, objects, and phenomena to protect the world from potential threats.

SCP-096 is described as a humanoid creature that appears to be emaciated and has a hairless body. Its most distinctive feature is its extremely elongated arms and fingers. It is usually docile and unresponsive to external stimuli until someone views its face, whether directly, through photographs, or even video footage. Once its face is seen, SCP-096 will enter an extremely agitated state and begin to display violent and hostile behavior.

Here are some key characteristics and behaviors of SCP-096:

Extreme Aggression: When someone views SCP-096's face, it will react with intense aggression and immediately set out to locate and kill the person who saw its face. It will not stop until it reaches the person, even if they are located far away.

Unstoppable Pursuit: SCP-096's pursuit of the viewer is relentless and seemingly unstoppable. It can travel great distances to reach the person who viewed its face.

Protective Measures: To contain SCP-096, the Foundation uses specialized procedures. This includes keeping it in a steel cube with no windows and remotely feeding it to prevent accidental visual contact. When anyone views its face, it triggers an alarm and sends a task force to neutralize the threat.

Emotional Response: Despite its aggression, SCP-096 is often portrayed as seemingly distressed or emotionally affected by people viewing its face, as if it is in a state of extreme anguish or fear.

Regeneration: SCP-096 has shown remarkable regenerative abilities, able to heal quickly from injuries. It's almost indestructible, making it difficult to terminate.

The SCP-096 article is a popular and well-known entry in the SCP Foundation database, and it has inspired various forms of media, including stories, art, and even video games, all within the context of the SCP Foundation's fictional universe. The character's distinctive blend of unstoppable aggression and apparent emotional vulnerability has made it a memorable and iconic part of the SCP mythos.
