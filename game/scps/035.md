# SCP-035
![scp-35.png](/images/roles/scp-35.png){.align-left}SCP-035, also known as "The Possessive Mask," is a fictional object and entity in the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. It is a highly dangerous and malevolent artifact with anomalous properties. Here is a detailed description of SCP-035:

Appearance: SCP-035 is an ornate porcelain mask with features resembling a classic theatrical tragedy mask. Despite its inanimate appearance, it emits a warmth and a level of sentience that belies its true nature.

Possession: The primary anomalous property of SCP-035 is its ability to influence and possess individuals. When someone wears the mask, they become entirely under its control. The mask can communicate with its host and manipulate their actions, often driving them to commit heinous and violent acts.

Manipulation: SCP-035 is known for its persuasive and manipulative abilities. It can use psychological tactics to convince the host to carry out its sinister instructions, often causing harm or destruction.

Host Corruption: Over time, the host wearing SCP-035 experiences physical and psychological degradation. The mask's possession leads to the host's body rotting and decaying, while their mind becomes increasingly twisted.

Containment: SCP-035 is stored in a sealed glass container filled with a special corrosive liquid to prevent escape and to maintain containment. Special precautions are taken to ensure that it doesn't come into contact with any personnel.

Intelligence: SCP-035 exhibits signs of malevolent intelligence. It has its own motives and goals, which are not entirely understood, but they usually involve causing chaos and harm through its host.

SCP-035 is considered one of the most dangerous and enigmatic objects within the SCP Foundation's universe. Its ability to manipulate and control individuals, leading them to commit terrible acts, makes it a highly sought-after item by those who wish to harness its power, even as the Foundation works tirelessly to prevent it from causing harm.
