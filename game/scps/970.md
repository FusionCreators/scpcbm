**SCP-970**, also known as "The Recursive Room," is a fictional entry in the SCP Foundation's collaborative writing project. *SCP-970 is a unique and perplexing anomaly with an eerie twist.*

**Description**:
**SCP-970** is a standard, windowless room of an undetermined size. *It appears to be a standard containment chamber, with walls, floor, and ceiling made of concrete. However, what makes SCP-970 anomalous is its ability to repeat itself infinitely in all three dimensions, creating recursive, fractal-like architecture. When you enter SCP-970, you will find another instance of SCP-970 within, and so on, creating a seemingly endless and complex series of interconnected chambers. It gives the impression of a never-ending space filled with repeating rooms.*

**Properties**:

Each instance of **SCP-970** is identical to the previous one, except for its placement within the recursive pattern.
*While it appears infinite, the chambers are limited by the physical boundaries of the room, and the recursive pattern eventually reaches its physical limit. The exact size of SCP-970 is unknown and impossible to measure.*
When you exit **SCP-970**, you emerge from the same instance you entered.
If you make alterations to one instance of **SCP-970**, the changes will propagate throughout the entire pattern.
**Exploration** and **Research**:
**SCP-970** has been explored extensively by the SCP Foundation, *and researchers have made various attempts to map its structure, but it remains an unsolved puzzle due to its infinite nature.*

**Use** and **Caution**:
**SCP-970** is considered Safe because it does not appear to pose any immediate threats to personnel. However, its effects on the human psyche are not fully understood, *and long-term exposure is discouraged. The Foundation uses it for experimentation and occasionally for containment of other SCPs due to its unique containment properties.*

**SCP-970** is a fascinating example of the type of surreal and mind-bending anomalies often found in the SCP Foundation's universe, *emphasizing the mysterious and often disorienting nature of the objects and phenomena contained by the Foundation.*
