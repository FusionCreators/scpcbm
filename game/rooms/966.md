# SCP-966's Containment Chamber
![966_inner_chamber_1.webp](/images/rooms/966_inner_chamber_1.webp =400x){.align-left}[SCP-966](/en/game/scps/966)'s containment chamber consists of three different rooms: The first room is a J-shaped corridor with three doors, two of them leading into other rooms while the third leading to a control room. The door to the room requires a [level 3 keycard](/e/en/game/items/Keycards) to enter. The control room can also be entered directly from another room, but the door still requires a level 3 keycard.

The control room contains a few control panels, tables, chairs, and a door leading into the chamber itself. The chamber is featureless outside of a security camera overseeing the room and a pair of [night vision goggles](/en/game/items/nvg) that can be found on the floor. Multiple [SCP-966](/en/game/scps/966) instances may also be found in this room.
