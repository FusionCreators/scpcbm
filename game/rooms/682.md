# Large Testing Chamber
![largechamber.webp](/images/rooms/largechamber.webp =400x){.align-left}This chamber is a two-level room with balconies lining either side, along the entrances. Going left leads to a small blast door which is blocked by a DNA scanner. Going right leads to a set of metal stairs to the first floor. Right across from those stairs is another set leading up to the second balcony, as well as the entryway to the rest of the lower level. The main room is accessible through a door, and inside, the player will see [SCP-682](/en/game/scps/682)'s document in front of a large, sealed blast door. Above the blast door, is a series of vents, with a security camera right below the closest left vent. If the player goes over to pick it up, gas will start spewing from the pipes in the room and [SCP-079](/en/game/scps/079) will speak over the intercom saying "You're not getting out."

[SCP-1048](/en/game/scps/1048) can be found aimlessly wandering around one of the entrances to the room.
