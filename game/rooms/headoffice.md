# Head Office
![headoffice.webp](/images/rooms/headoffice.webp =400x){.align-left}The head office requires a [level 4 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) to access. On one of the desks lays a picture of Radical Larry an alias that [SCP-106](/en/game/rooms/106) has been associated with based on this family portrait, two joints of [SCP-420-J](/en/game/items/weed), the nuclear warheads document, a [radio](/en/game/items/radio), and a level 5 keycard.

It can be assumed that this office belongs to Site Director Rosewood, as messages from her email can be read on a monitor, with the client service being "ROSEWOOD_OFFICE".
