# Maintenance Tunnels
![tunnels.webp](/images/rooms/tunnels.webp =400x){.align-left}At the entrance of the maintenance tunnels, there are two elevators separated by a blast door. A scorched note can be found on the ground next to the blast door. If the player finds SCP-372's document, the code to the blast door will be written on the bottom of it. Alternatively, the player can use the elevators to reach the other side via the maintenance tunnels themselves. The tunnels are dark and grim, making them difficult to navigate. The player can also find a small generator room, in which a pair of night-vision goggles and an SCP-500 pill can be found.

It is advised that the player navigates the tunnels quickly since SCP-106 will spawn in front of the player's entrance. An instance of SCP-966 can also appear in the tunnels near the opposite elevator.
