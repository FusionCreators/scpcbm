# SCP-106's Containment Chamber
![106_containment.webp](/images/rooms/106_containment.webp =400x){.align-left}[SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106)'s containment chamber requires a [level 4 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) to be accessed. Inside the room is a catwalk overseeing SCP-106's chamber itself. The catwalk leads to a flight of stairs heading down to a control room. The control room contains a monitor with two switches and a button. A [level 5 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards), Dr. Allok's note, and a document about the recall protocol, the main purpose of this chamber, can be found on a desk.

At the end of the room, a security camera can be seen on the ceiling to the right. Another door (requiring a level 4 keycard) leads into the secondary chamber. Within the room stands SCP-106's primary chamber; a sealed container comprised of lead-lined steel surrounded with an iron fence.
