# SCP-008 Containment chamber
![zombie_room_(1).webp](/images/rooms/zombie_room_(1).webp =400x){.align-left}The layout of [SCP-008](/en/game/rooms/008)'s containment chamber consists of three small rooms. The first two doors are reached from a small main room, both of which need [level 4](/en/game/items/Keycards) keycards to open. The first room is a control room, containing a table with SCP-008's document and a control panel with an interactive monitor. The second room is a small airlock with a decontaminating shower head and storage area containing a hazmat suit propped up on a stand.

The third room can be entered from the airlock and contains a security camera at the top right and SCP-008's canister, which is opened and releasing gas. This room is visible from the control room via two large windows, as well as the storage area via a single small window. [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) will spawn behind the larger windows and will break the glass in an attempt to reach the player.

If the player isn't wearing the hazmat suit when this occurs, a piece of glass from the window will cut the player's arm, infecting them with SCP-008. Once its canister is closed, the lockdown on the [Heavy Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/hcz) will be lifted, allowing access to the [Entrance Zone](/en/game/rooms/ent) through the checkpoint room.
