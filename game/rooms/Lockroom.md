# T-Shaped Lockroom
The T-Shaped Lockroom is a red-lit room in the shape of a T, as the name implies. Once the player enters this room, they must take a turn down the short, intersecting closet to press the button. Once the button is pressed, it will open one door and then close the other. The player must be wary of these rooms, as [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) will often spawn in the offshoot hallway, below the ventilation shaft.
