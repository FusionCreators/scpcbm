# Entrance zone
![entrn.png](/images/rooms/entrn.png =500x){.align-left}The Entrance Zone (originally called the Office Zone, and mistakenly called the Research Zone) is the final zone encountered in the game. It is preceded by the [Light Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/lcz) and [Heavy Containment](/en/game/rooms/hcz) Zone. It is dedicated to the research and administrative division of the site and is distinguished by a clean, sterile environment, adorned with white walls and painted orange stripes.

[Nine-Tailed Fox](/en/game/jobs/mtf) enters the facility once the player reaches this zone, requiring players to remain undetected to avoid being terminated.

This zone also contains the facility's exits, making it the final location encountered inside the facility.
