# SCP Storage Chamber
![room_2_scps_-_back.webp](/images/rooms/room_2_scps_-_back.webp =400x){.align-left}These identical chambers are accessed from a pair of doors facing each other in the middle of a central hallway overlooked by a small balcony. Both these doors and the set of doors following them require a level 3 keycard, and both lead to identical small rooms with three doors.

In one room, the left door leads to [SCP-714](/en/game/scps/714)'s chamber, containing a small storage room with a pedestal. SCP-714 can be seen on top of this pedestal and is able to be acquired and used. SCP-714's document can be found on top of a cabinet sitting in the right corner next to the door. A security camera can be seen on the ceiling overhead. The right door leads to SCP-427's containment chamber and contains an empty wooden box, a security camera, and [SCP-427](/en/game/scps/427)'s document. A blood trail leads from outside the hallway into this room.

Inside the other door is another small room with two accessible doors - the door to the right leads to [SCP-1025](/en/game/scps/1025)â€™s chamber, while the door opposite contains [SCP-860](/en/game/items/scp-860).

SCP-1025's room is of the same shape and layout as SCP-714's, with the pedestal, cabinet, and security camera in the same places. SCP-1025 sits atop the pedestal in this room, and can also be acquired.

SCP-860's room is largely empty of anything else, save for a wooden box atop the pedestal containing SCP-860.
