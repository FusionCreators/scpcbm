# SCP-860 Testing Chamber
![doortestroom.webp](/images/rooms/doortestroom.webp =400x){.align-left}[SCP-860](/en/game/items/scp-860)'s testing chamber consists of a wooden door that can only be unlocked from either side using SCP-860. The room's only purpose is to allow the player to reach SCP-860-1.

There's also a control room that is guarded with a passcode lock, however, one door will always be open allowing the player to access it. The room was used to communicate and view the video feed of any person while they were inside SCP-860-1. It contains SCP-860's document, SCP-860-1's document, a readable monitor, a microphone, and a computer monitor.
