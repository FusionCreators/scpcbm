# Storage bathroom
![t.webp](/images/rooms/t.webp =400x){.align-left}This used to be the first room that the player comes across after the breach. It consists of a walkway with a door halfway through the room, behind which a janitor and a scientist can be heard trying to escape. Shortly after entering the room, the lights start flickering rapidly before [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) kills them both.

On the opposite side of the hallway is one room which contains a [gas mask](/en/game/items/gas-mask), a document on SCP-173, a [level 1 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards), and a few batteries. But caution should be advised, as if the player stays in that room for too long, SCP-173 will open the door to the room. If SCP-173 is disabled or captured by the [NTF](/en/game/jobs/mtf) somehow, no NPCs will spawn, and no bodies.
