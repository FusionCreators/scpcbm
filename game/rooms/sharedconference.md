# Shared Conference Room
![entrancezoneoffices3.webp](/images/rooms/entrancezoneoffices3.webp =400x){.align-left}The shared conference room is found next to a T-shaped hallway, notable by the large glass divider separating the hallway itself from the room. The room contains a series of desks and chairs facing towards a whiteboard.

Hanging on the furthest wall are three portraits showing [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein), [Dr. D.H. Aeslinger](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/crayne-author), and [Dr. Gears](/en/game/jobs/scientists)
