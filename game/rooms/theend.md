# End Room
- [:arrow_backward: Back *Go back to the rooms page.*](/en/game/rooms)
{.links-list}

The end room is a red-lit room containing a locked blast door. Currently, it only serves as a dead end. An alarm can be heard blaring from the other side of the blast door.

There's a chance that a [janitor](/en/game/jobs/janitor) may spawn inside one of the end rooms. While within the vicinity of the room, the player can hear him calling out for help inside. Once the player enters the room, the janitor starts walking toward them, curious about the player's identity. The janitor is then cut off by [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106) suddenly emerging and pulling him through the ground into the Pocket Dimension, leaving a corrosion spot. If the player is near the janitor when he is abducted, SCP-106 will spawn and begin to pursue the player.

The end room can also be found in the [Entrance Zone](/en/game/rooms/ent). A smaller, much more crude, and grimy variant can be found in the [Heavy Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/hcz).
