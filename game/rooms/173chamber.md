# SCP-173 Chamber
![173bright.webp](/images/rooms/173bright.webp =500x){.align-left}This is the first room that the player will come across before the breach. It consists of the containment chamber for [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173), an inaccessible door to the right, a balcony to the left where the ladder and spectator present on the platform, and a room where the intercom voice resides. After the breach events starts and you walk down the stairs on the right from where the scientists are working at, SCP-173 can be seen with a guard directly staring at it. If 173 is disabled, the guard can be seen walking backwards with a Class-D far behind him.
