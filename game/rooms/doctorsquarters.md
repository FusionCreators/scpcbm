# Doctors Quarters
The Doctors Quarters is a T-shaped room containing the offices of Dr. Maynard, Dr. Harp, and Dr. Gears.

## Dr. Maynard's Office
> WARNING: The following may contain spoilers about the game.
{.is-warning}

![doctorsquarters.webp](/images/rooms/doctorsquarters.webp =400x){.align-right}The key code to access this room can be found on the burnt note in the Pocket Dimension. Upon entering this room, the player can find the Mysterious Note, a [ballistic vest](/en/game/items/ballistic-vest), and a monitor which displays a conversation with an unknown client, simply stating "It's out", with the response "Proceeding".

The conversation is actually between Dr. Maynard and Agent Skinner, who is cryptically telling [Dr. Maynard](/en/game/jobs/scientists) that he has released [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106) from containment and that Maynard should proceed with the rest of the plan. This can be backed up by the fact that the timestamps coincide with SCP-106's breach before the game, at 09:21 hours.

Spoilers end here.

## Dr. Harp's Office
The key code to access this room is 7816. It can be discovered via a randomly triggered conversation on channel 5 of the radio. Security Cheif Franklin permits Dr. Harp to [broadcast](/en/game/items/radio) the code, allowing the player to retrieve the code and use it.

It contains a [first aid kit](/en/game/items/first-aid-kit), a journal entry from Jim Gonzales, and a document describing Incident Report [SCP-106-0204](/en/game/plot).

## Dr. Gears' Office
The office of [Dr. Gears](/en/game/jobs/scientists) cannot be accessed and is presumed to serve no other purpose than to reference a Foundation site member of the same name.
