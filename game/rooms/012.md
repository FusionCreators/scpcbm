# SCP-012 Chamber
![012.webp](/images/rooms/012.webp =400x){.align-left}Behind a keycard-locked door and down a flight of stairs lies [SCP-012's chamber](/en/game/scps/012). The first door requires a [level 3 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards). At the bottom of the stairs is a room with a control panel with SCP-012's document sitting on it. The panel has a button labelled "Hoist", a powered-on computer screen from where the "On Mount Golgotha" score plays, and a label reading "Caution Lights On" with a light above it that flashes red when the lights in the second room are on. In the next room is SCP-012 itself, suspended in a container by an automated pulley system. When close enough to the entrance, [SCP-079](/en/game/scps/079) opens it and lowers the container with SCP-012 in it, forcing the player to walk towards it and mutilate themselves. If the player is wearing  [SCP-714](/en/game/scps/714) he will be inmune to SCP-012 effects and can walk freely in the room. A severed hand is available inside the chamber.
