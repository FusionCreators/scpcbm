# Containment Room 5
![room2scps2.webp](/images/rooms/room2scps2.webp =400x){.align-right}Containment Room 5 is the name given to the area of the facility that houses [SCP-500](/en/game/scps/500) and [SCP-1499](/en/game/scps/1499). It can be accessed through a door found off to the side of one of the hallways with a [level 3 keycard](/e/en/game/items/Keycards).

The room contains the doors to SCP-500 and SCP-1499's storage rooms along with a small workspace and a computer. [Emily Ross's badge](/en/game/items/badge) can be found on the floor near the workspace. SCP-500's [document](/en/game/items/documents) can be found on top of its safe, while SCP-1499's document can be found on a cabinet.

SCP-500 was stored inside a safe, which is opened and empty by the time the player comes across it. SCP-1499 is stored inside an open, wooden box.
