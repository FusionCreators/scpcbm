# SCP-372 Chamber
![372chamber.webp](/images/rooms/372chamber.webp =400x){.align-left}This room is composed of a cube of plexiglass, a control panel with [SCP-372](/en/game/scps/372)'s document and a shelf with a [radio](/en/game/items/radio). Entering it doesn't require a [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) since the containment door is already opened. The chamber's entrance door is open as well, but the chamber does not have any supplies inside. When the room is first entered, a rustling noise can be faintly heard and SCP-372 will start following the player until they die, or save before encountering SCP-372.
