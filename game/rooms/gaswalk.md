# Gas Catwalk
![room2pit.webp](/images/rooms/room2pit.webp =400x){.align-left}The gas catwalk consists of an L-shaped catwalk with a line of pipes that spew decontamination gas as a security measure. The shorter end of the catwalk contains an inaccessible door. The player is advised to wear a [gas mask](/en/game/items/gas-mask) when traversing this room, as [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) is known to spawn in the shorter end.
