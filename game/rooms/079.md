{.is-warning}

![scp-079_chamber.webp](/images/rooms/scp-079_chamber.webp =500x){.align-left}To enter [SCP-079](/en/game/scps/079)'s containment chamber, the player requires a [level 4 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) to access it. The blast door will not fully open due to SCP-079 keeping it shut. The player will need to disable the remote door control system inside the electrical room in order to enter the chamber.

After entering the chamber, the player will find a small flight of stairs leading to SCP-079 itself, which is stored on an old computer, surrounded by a gate.
