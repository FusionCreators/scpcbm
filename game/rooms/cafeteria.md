# Cafeteria
![cafeteria5.webp](/images/rooms/cafeteria5.webp =500x){.align-left} The cafeteria consists of a catwalk as well as a larger, lower level, both being connected by stairs. It contains several tables and a counter. Most tables have cups and plates of food leftover which shows that the cafeteria was probably previously occupied sometime before the breach. Two quarters can also be found under a table and on a desk.

This room also houses [SCP-294](/en/game/scps/294), which is placed opposite the counter. SCP-066 can also be found on the lower level, assuming it hasnâ€™t wandered off to another room yet.
