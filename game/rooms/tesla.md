# Tesla Gate
![hczteslagate.webp](/images/rooms/hczteslagate.webp =400x){.align-left}Tesla gates are a minor hazard in SCP:CB, but play a major role. They are large devices situated in certain hallways, and activate when approached by any entity, shocking it with electricity. Upon discovering the first tesla gate, a Scientist will run through and get shocked by it, dying instantly. The gate begins charging up as soon as anything comes within close proximity of it, and the Player can bypass it by simply getting close enough, retreating during the charge up period, then running through after it delivers the shock. The recharge time is very short, thus the player should exercise caution and not longer for too long within the gate, otherwise they may be shocked and killed.
