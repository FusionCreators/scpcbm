# Storage Hallway with SCP-970
![infhallway.png](/images/rooms/infhallway.png =500x){.align-left}The [SCP-970](/en/game/scps/970) hallway consists of a regular hallway with two doors on both sides. Upon opening these doors, the player can find a battery, an empty cup, a [level 1 key card](/en/game/items/Keycards), and various documents. Please note that when crossing through the doors, eventually the door loops around the room to the opposite side, making it seem like one has crossed into another room. It will make the player blink every time they go through the door.
