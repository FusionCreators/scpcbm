# Storage Area 6
![str.png](/images/rooms/str.png =400x){.align-left}This room can be accessed through an elevator in the [Light Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/lcz). It contains many crates and boxes, but most importantly, three [SCP-939](/en/game/scps/939) instances. There is a black severed hand that can spawn in two random locations. The black severed hand can be used to operate the DNA scanner at [SCP 049](/en/game/scps/049)'s containment chamber. [Night Vision Goggles](/en/game/items/nvg) are in one of the corridors in the room.
