# 2-Level Office
A basic office with stairs to a second level. It contains a [level 1 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards), [SCP-895](/en/game/rooms/895)'s document, [SCP-860](/en/game/items/scp-860)'s document, the SCP-093 recovered materials document, and an [S-Nav 300](/en/game/items/SNAV). An [anomalous duck](/en/game/scps/ducks) can also be found sitting atop certain heights in this room.

Another variation of this room can be found, notable by the glass dividers which line the area between the upper and lower sections of the room. Each side of the lower level contains 4 desks, facing opposite each other. On one of the sides, a poster can be found of [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) seen alongside the [Moai statues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moai) on Easter Island.
