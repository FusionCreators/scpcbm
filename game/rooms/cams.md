# Surveillance Room
This room can be accessed with a [level 3 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) and opens to a stairwell. Once at the top, there will be Computers sitting in 2 rows near the middle, a door that doesn't open, and the main door which has the Surveillance Room on the inside with lots of monitors, a desk with a [level 4 keycar](/en/game/items/Keycards), and a Control Panel in the middle of the room. Once the Security Office door is opened, [SCP-049](/en/game/scps/049) will walk up the stairs and look around. It is advised that once you enter the room, you should quickly lift the Light Containment Zone Lockdown. 049 will chase you out of there, or it will kill you. An alternative, possible method would be to try and hide behind the center table as it walks into the room and hope it does not see you (untested by multiple, further testing of theory would be needed(or a source) to prove the strategy works.)
