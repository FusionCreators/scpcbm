# Server Hub
![entrancezoneserversinside.webp](/images/rooms/entrancezoneserversinside.webp =400x){.align-left}The entrance to the server hub appears next to one of the doors in a two-way hallway and requires a [level 3 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) to access. The door leads to a staircase that goes down into the room itself.

At the bottom of the stairs on the left is an inaccessible door and on the right is a small workstation. At the station is a computer monitor with a sticky note attached to it saying:

"GO TO THE CAFETERIA AND GET A PIZZA
FIX ERRORS IN SERVER B_1
CLEAN SHAUN'S PC FROM SHIT!".

Next to the workstation is a glass panel viewing into a blue, dimly lit room full of servers. This room can be accessed from a door next to the workstation with a [level 3 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards).

At the far right of the server room, a pair of [night-vision goggles](/en/game/items/nvg) can be found.
