# SCP-096 Lock room
![lockroom2.webp](/images/rooms/lockroom2.webp =400x){.align-left}[SCP-096](/en/game/scps/096)'s lockroom is very similar to a regular lockroom, however, this room does not have any doors or decontamination gas. SCP-096 can be found in the center of the room sitting down with several blood splatters around it (assumed to be victims of SCP-096). Outside both entrances is a CCTV monitor showing the view of two security cameras above each door. It is recommended that the player walks behind SCP-096 to ensure that they will not trigger it.
