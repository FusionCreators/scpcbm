# Server Farm
![serverroom1.webp](/images/rooms/serverroom1.webp =400x){.align-left}The server farm is a three-door, two-level room with a catwalk connecting the two upper doors. There are stairs leading to the lower floor, which the player will need to get through to reach the third door in the room. The lower floor is full of computer servers making them difficult to navigate. [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) and [MTF](/en/game/jobs/mtf) units frequently spawn on the lower floor, so the player should be wary.

This room has two variations, meaning the path in the lower level will not always be the same. The first variant of the room contains a shelf holding up to three 9V batteries and an S-Nav 300. The second variant contains [SCP-970](/en/game/scps/970)'s document and a gas mask.

The white anomalous duck can be found sitting on the floor in the first variant of the room.
