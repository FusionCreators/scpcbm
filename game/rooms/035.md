# SCP-035's Containment Chamber
![035_containmentroom.webp](/images/rooms/035_containmentroom.webp =400x){.align-left}[SCP-035](/en/game/scps/035)'s containment chamber is comprised of four rooms.

The third room is a small airlock-type room that leads to the fourth and final room. It also contains a storage area with empty hazmat suit stands.
