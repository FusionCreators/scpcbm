# Light Testing Chamber 2B
The testing chamber is located inside a hallway. Upon opening the keycard-locked door in the hallway, the player will find an inoperable door in front of him and an accessible door to his immediate left. He will find the test room itself behind that door, which contains a [level 2 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) and an [S-Nav 300](/en/game/items/SNAV). The test room is separated in two sections, one where the observer is, and the other which is separated by glass and a door. Inside the other section, [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) will spawn and follow a guided path around the room until he will break the glass. Because of this, it is recommended that the player blink before he enters the test room, as SCP-173 will kill him if he blinks or if he takes his eyes off of it.
