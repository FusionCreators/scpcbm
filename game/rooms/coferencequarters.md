# Conference Quarters
## Dr. L.'s Office
![106torment.webp](/images/rooms/106torment.webp =400x){.align-left} The door to this office will automatically open once the player passes by it unless the door control has been disabled, but it can also be opened with the passcode 1234. The interior of the office is covered in the moss stone seen in the Pocket Dimension. In addition, the sound of rushing water can be heard inside the room. [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106)'s breathing can be heard from behind the walls. Two burnt notes can be found inside along with a readable monitor.

The notes left by Dr. L. constantly referring to SCP-106 tormenting him, and the fact that the room itself appears to have been corroded by it, all leads to the presumption that SCP-106 captured him.

Conference Room
Conference Room 9B is located opposite Dr. L.'s office. It seems to have been previously abandoned, as the room is in minor disarray, with various materials still on the table, such as papers, a book, and a few computers.

On the far side of the room are 3 monitors, one of which is readable, containing a message from an O5 member detailing how the breach is being dealt with, suggesting the conference room was previously occupied by surviving personnel.
