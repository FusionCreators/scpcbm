# Light - Heavy Containment Zone Checkpoint Room
![checkpoint1flashingscreen.webp](/images/rooms/checkpoint1flashingscreen.webp =500x){.align-left}This room stands as a hub from and to the [Heavy Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/hcz). If you have not lifted the [Light Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/lcz) Lockdown in the [Surveillance Room](/en/game/rooms/cams), you will not be able to get through to the Heavy Containment Zone, even with an [Omni Clearance](/en/game/items/Keycards). It will instead flash a screen saying to disable the lockdown in the Surveillance Room and how [SCP-008](/en/game/scps/008) has breached containment.
