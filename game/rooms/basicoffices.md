# Basic office
![basicofficev7.webp](/images/rooms/basicofficev7.webp =400x){.align-left}A small, one-story office containing computers, unobtainable files, and a monitor. It also contains a [Level 2 Keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards#level-2-keycard), [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106)'s document, a notice regarding the use of nicknames in reports, and an S-Nav 300.

Should [SCP-035](/en/game/scps/035) have been released by now, the player can find its corpse in one of these offices. If they approach the corpse, [tentacle](/en/game/scps/035) appendages will rise out of it and attack them.
