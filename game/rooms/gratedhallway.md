# Grated Hallway
![gratedhallway.webp](/images/rooms/gratedhallway.webp =400x){.align-left}The grated hallway is a short hallway with grating going down the length of the floor and ceiling. Upon entering this hallway [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106) has a chance of emerging from one side of the wall, then stop in the middle of the hallway as it's crossing to the opposite wall. It will look around and if it spots the player, it will begin chasing them. The player should crouch if SCP-106 emerges from the wall, as he will not notice the player and continue to the opposite wall..
