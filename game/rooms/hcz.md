# Heavy Containment zone
![hcz.png](/images/rooms/hcz.png =500x){.align-left}The Heavy Containment Zone is the second zone encountered in the game. It is preceded by the [Light Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/lcz) and followed by the [Entrance Zone](/en/game/rooms/ent). It is strictly used for the containment of high-level SCP objects, such as [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106) and [SCP-049](/en/game/scps/049). Due to this, it is constructed with a distinctive rudimentary style, abundant with grimy tunnels and catwalks. Decontamination gas is frequently encountered in the Heavy Containment Zone as part of an extended security protocol.

To access the Heavy Containment Zone, the player must either escape from the Pocket Dimension, which will deposit them in one of several rooms in the Zone, or lift the zone's lockdown from the surveillance room.

In order to get through the Heavy Containment's checkpoint, [SCP-008](/en/game/scps/008) must be recontained by closing the gas canister inside it's containment chamber. Once it is recontained the lockdown on the zone will be lifted, granting access to the Entrance Zone.
