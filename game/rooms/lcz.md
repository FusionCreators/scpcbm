# Light Containment Zone
![lcz.png](/images/rooms/lcz.png =393x){.align-left}The Light Containment Zone is the first zone encountered in the game. It is followed by the [Heavy Containment](/en/game/rooms/hcz) Zone and [Entrance Zone](/en/game/rooms/ent). It is primarily used for containment and storage, mostly of lower-level SCP objects, such as [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173) and [SCP-914](/en/game/scps/914). It is characterized by its high roofed, concrete architecture.

In order to get through the Light Containment's checkpoint, a lever must be flipped in the [surveillance](/en/game/rooms/cams) room to lift the lockdown off the zone, granting access to the Heavy Containment Zone.
