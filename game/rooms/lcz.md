# Light Containment Zone
![lcz.png](/images/rooms/lcz.png =400x){.align-left}In the game, the first zone you encounter is the Light Containment Zone. The [Heavy Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/hcz) and [Entrance Zone ](/en/game/rooms/ent)follow. Known for its high roof and concrete architecture, it is primarily used to contain and store lower-level SCP objects, including [SCP-173](/en/game/scps/173)and [SCP-914](/en/game/scps/914).

A lever in the [surveillance room](/en/game/rooms/cams) must be flipped in order to lift the lockdown from the Light Containment zone, allowing access to the Heavy Containment zone.
