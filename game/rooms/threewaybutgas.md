# three-Way Gas Catwalk
![threewaycatwalk.webp](/images/rooms/threewaycatwalk.webp =400x){.align-left}The three-way gas catwalk is a Y-shaped variant of the gas catwalk. The room contains two unreachable gas tanks that can be seen at either corner of the room, though the gas spewing out of it is never able to reach the player.

Upon entering the room there is a chance that the player could encounter an anomalous duck, sitting atop one of the gas canisters. When the player looks away from the duck it will begin playing a random collection of saxophone notes.

An alternate event can occur as well where SCP-1048 will be on the canister, holding a pen and paper. When the player passes by SCP-1048, it will wave at them and hold up its drawing. Said drawing often depicts D-9341 in some form of peril. As soon as the player takes the drawing SCP-1048 will disappear.
