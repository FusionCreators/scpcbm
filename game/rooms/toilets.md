# Toilets
![255px-srcreentoilet.webp](/images/rooms/255px-srcreentoilet.webp =400x){.align-left}The toilets appear in a plain hallway with a WC sign above the entrance in the center of the room. This door splits off into the men's and women's restrooms, which both compose of a sink and a few stalls. As an easter egg, SCP-789-J has an 80% chance of being heard by the player.

When the player is about to enter the outside corridor, the sounds of a crying [guard](/en/game/jobs/guard) can be heard. If the player approaches, the guard panics and shoots themselves before the player can see them. The guard's body will be on the floor of the men's restroom, with a pool of blood slowly forming around the head.
