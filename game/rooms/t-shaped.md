# T-Shaped Room
![room3_2.webp](/images/rooms/room3_2.webp =500x){.align-left}The T-Shaped Room is a room in the form of a "T" and is mainly here to link all the other rooms together. Two variations of this room can be found.

The first variant has a grated off area with some guns. The second variant contains water pipes instead, accompanied by the sounds of dripping water. An event can randomly occur when the player enters this variation where a scientist's corpse will fall from the ceiling after [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106) ejects him from the Pocket Dimension. Some people believe this scientist is Dr. L. As of v1.0 there is a second event which randomly occurs, where a large corrosion sinkhole appears. If the player walks too close to the center of the sinkhole, they will be dragged into the Pocket Dimension. Therefore, it is advised to go around the outer edge of the sinkhole in order to avoid this.
