# ALPHA WARHEAD
![alpha_wahread.jpg](/images/rooms/alpha_wahread.jpg =400x){.align-left}A small circular room with a catwalk around the perimeter and the Omega warhead nestled in the very center. To enter the room and use the elevator that takes the player down to it, they must have a [level 5 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards). Once the player walks across the catwalk around the Omega warhead, they will find a room that requires a [level 5 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) to enter. Inside the room on a control panel are two levers; "Remote Detonation Omega Warheads" and "Remote Detonation Alpha Warheads". These can be turned off, which will change the game's endings. A document written by Dr. Harp can be found on the table next to a [ballistic vest](/en/game/items/ballistic-vest).
