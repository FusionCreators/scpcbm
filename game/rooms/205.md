# SCP-205's Containment Chamber
![205_observation_deck.webp](/images/rooms/205_observation_deck.webp =400x){.align-right}SCP-205's containment chamber is divided into three rooms; an L-shaped hallway, an observation room, and the containment chamber itself. The door between the hallway and the observation room requires a [level 3 keycard.](/e/en/game/items/Keycards)

Between the chamber and the observation room is a window, showing the SCP-205 pair facing a projector screen on the opposite wall. On the other side of the observation room is a readable monitor and a door leading to the housing chamber, which is locked.

When the horned male figures begin appearing on the screen, the door to the chamber will open. If the player enters the chamber all three figures will look up and stare at the player, moments before the lamps turn off and the door closes. After this occurs the figures will attack the player.

If the player stares through the window for too long, then the SCP-895 camera feed will be produced on the wall.
