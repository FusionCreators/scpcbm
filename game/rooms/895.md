# SCP-895's Containment Chamber
![895room.webp](/images/rooms/895room.webp =400x){.align-left}[SCP-895](/en/game/rooms/895)'s containment chamber consists of a two-story chamber that can be entered using a [level 2 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards). The stories are separated by quarter landing stairs, which contain a security camera on the ceiling overlooking the stairs.

To the left of the staircase is a control room in which a CCTV monitor overlooking SCP-895â€™s main chamber, an interactive monitor, and SCP-895's document can be found. Viewing the CCTV monitor feed for too long will kill the player, due to SCP-895's effects. This room also contains a switch where the player can turn off SCP-895's feed. This also prevents [SCP-079](/en/game/scps/079) from broadcasting the feed over the facility's other CCTV monitors.

Going down the flight of stairs leads to a short hallway. At the end of the hallway is the room holding SCP-895 itself. On the ground beside it is a [level 3 keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) and a pair of night-vision goggles. If the player approaches the coffin, [SCP-106](/en/game/scps/106) will spawn directly in front of it and proceed to pursue the player. If the player enters the room a second time after evading SCP-106, it will not appear again.
