# Medical Bay
![medical_by.webp](/images/rooms/medical_by.webp =400x){.align-left}The medical bay is a section of the Entrance Zone that was presumably used to treat minor medical conditions, given the room's small size. It consists of three stretchers with one obscured by a hospital curtain, a fire extinguisher on the wall, and a control panel with a lamp and two syringes on it. The walls are lined with green stripes, similar to the [Entrance Zone](/en/game/rooms/ent)'s orange stripes. A [first aid kit](/en/game/items/first-aid-kit) can be found underneath one of the stretchers, as well as an [SCP-008](/en/game/scps/008) infected human leaning against the wall. Going near it will cause the lights to go out and the person to stand up and pursue the player.
