# Small Server room
![smallserverroom2.webp](/images/rooms/smallserverroom2.webp =400x){.align-left}The small server room is one of the main locations where SCP-096 can be found. There are two doors leading into this room, which are separated by a locked door in the outside hallway. Four small windows looking into the room line the wall, two on each side of the locked door. The room consists of two areas; the main room that houses several computer servers and a small control area with a panel.

Once the hall outside the area is entered, the entryways lock and a scene will play in which an enraged SCP-096 rips apart an unfortunate guard, causing blood to splatter on the windows and the lights to start flickering. Once the scene is finished, the doors open back up, and the player must enter the room to get around the locked door.

Once this room is entered, the doors lock back up, and the player must reset the power. At the far right side of the room, two switches can be found; the first switch activates a fuel pump that supplies fuel to the generator, the second activates the generator itself. This will be signified by the sound of the fuel pump doing its namesake.

In the back of the room, the entrance to the control area can be found. Inside will be a control panel with a power feed switch. The switch is set to 'Main' by default, implying that when SCP-096 killed the guard it may have damaged the equipment in the room, cutting off its supply of power from the main facility. Upon setting the switch to 'Generator', the room will begin pulling power from the backup generator, restoring functionality to the room's lights and doors, opening them. This is signified by the sound of the generator becoming active.

Caution must be exercised while performing these tasks, however, as SCP-096 aimlessly wanders around the room. Additionally, SCP-096 will follow the player if it sees them while docile, making it harder to avoid looking at its face by accident. The best way to enter and leave this room safely is to constantly look at the ground and hug the walls while searching for the walls while searching for the switches. When all three switches have been flipped, the two doors will open.
