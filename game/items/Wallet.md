# Wallet
![invwallet.webp](/images/items/invwallet.webp){.align-left}{.align-left}In the game "SCP - Containment Breach," the wallet is an item that can be found in various locations within the game's facility. The wallet is a useful item for several reasons:

Storage: The wallet can be used to store and carry certain items, such as keycards, documents, and other small objects. This is helpful because you have a limited inventory space, and the wallet allows you to carry more items with you.

SCP-914: The wallet can be used with SCP-914, also known as "The Clockwork," which is a machine that can refine and upgrade items. When you place the wallet in SCP-914's input booth and set the machine to "Fine" or "Very Fine" settings, you can get better items in return. This can be a valuable way to upgrade keycards or other important items.

Access Cards: The wallet can also store access cards like Level 1 and Level 2 keycards, allowing you to carry multiple keycards without taking up your limited inventory slots. This is particularly useful for progressing through the game by unlocking different doors and areas.

It's important to note that while the wallet can be quite helpful, you should be cautious and strategic about what you store in it. Some items can be destroyed or altered when placed in SCP-914, so it's important to understand how the machine works before using it with the wallet. Additionally, the wallet can't be used to store very large or cumbersome items, so it's not a solution for everything.
