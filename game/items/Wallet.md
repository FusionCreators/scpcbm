**Description**:
The wallet is an item that can be found at the lower part of the storeroom in the light сontaiment zone. The wallet is a useful item for several reasons:
⠀
⠀
⠀
⠀

⠀

**Storage**: The wallet can be used to store and carry certain items, *such as keycards, documents, and other small objects. This is helpful because you have a limited inventory space, and the wallet allows you to carry more items with you.*

**SCP-914**: The wallet can be used with SCP-914, also known as "The Clockwork," *which is a machine that can refine and upgrade items. When you place the wallet in SCP-914's input booth and set the machine to "Fine" or "Very Fine" settings, you can get better items in return. This can be a valuable way to upgrade keycards or other important items.*

**Access Cards**: The wallet can also store access cards like Level 1 and Level 2 keycards, *allowing you to carry multiple keycards without taking up your limited inventory slots. This is particularly useful for progressing through the game by unlocking different doors and areas.*

It's important to note that while the wallet can be quite helpful, you should be cautious and strategic about what you store in it. *Some items can be destroyed or altered when placed in SCP-914, so it's important to understand how the machine works before using it with the wallet. Additionally, the wallet can't be used to store very large or cumbersome items, so it's not a solution for everything.*
