The Severed Hand is an equippable item that spawns inside of [SCP-012](https://wiki.scpcbm.com/en/game/scps/012)'s [containment chamber](https://wiki.scpcbm.com/en/game/rooms/012). It can be used to operate the DNA Door at the [Large Testing Chamber](/en/game/rooms/682) and [SCP-079](/en/game/scps/079)'s [containment chamber](https://wiki.scpcbm.com/en/game/rooms/079). It can also be obtained by putting a Black Severed Hand inside [SCP-914 "The Clockworks"](/en/game/rooms/scp914) on the setting "1:1", "Fine" or "Very Fine".
