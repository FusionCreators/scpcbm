# Lost Key
![lost-key.png](/images/items/lost-key.png){.align-right}**Name**: `Lost Key`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`

The Lost Key is an equippable item that can only be obtained from [SCP-1162](/en/game/scps/1162).

Upon equipping the item for the first time, the following message will appear: "Isn't this the key to that old shack? The one where I... No, it can't be."

One of these sounds will play as well:

<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer6.ogg"></audio>
<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer7.ogg"></audio>
<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer8.ogg"></audio>
<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer9.ogg"></audio>
<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer10.ogg"></audio>

It is currently unknown what old shack is being mentioned and what was done in said shack.

Older versions of SCP: Containment Breach included SCP-1074, looking at it for a little while would provide hints leading towards the fact that the [main character](/en/game/plot) killed at least one person in the shack. Since SCP-1074 was removed from the game, this may not be true anymore.
