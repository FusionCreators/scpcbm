# SCP-427
![427.png](/images/items/427.png =200x){.align-right}**Name**: `SCP-427`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`

SCP-427 is an equippable item that, unlike most other SCP items, can not be found in it's respective containment chamber in the [Light Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/lcz). It can, however, be made by putting [SCP-500-01](/en/game/scps/scp-500) or the [Upgraded Pill](/en/game/scps/scp-500) inside of [SCP-914 "The Clockworks"](/en/game/scps/914) on the setting "Fine". If SCP-427 already exists, the [upgraded pill](/en/game/scps/scp-500) will appear in the output booth instead.

When the player equips it, the following message will appear: "You opened the locked."

While this item is equipped, it will slowly decrease the player's injuries and blood loss. The following sounds can be heard repeatedly coming from the item while equipped:

After the player opens the locket, they will die after 7 minutes of continuous exposure. The following messages and events will appear in order:

> You feel refreshed and energetic.

>You feel gentle muscle spasms all over your body.

>Your muscles are swelling. You feel more powerful than ever.

> After this message the player will start producing the following decal:

>You can't feel your legs. But you don't need legs anymore.

> After the last message, the player will be unable to stand up and dies shortly after.
