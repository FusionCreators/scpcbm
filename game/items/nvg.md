**Category**: `Equippable`
The Blue Night Vision Goggles are an equippable item that can be obtained by putting Night Vision Goggles in SCP 914 “The Clockworks” on the setting “Very Fine”. These Night Vision Goggles have a blue overlay and provide users with approximate locations and distances of all humans and SCPs every 10 seconds. Each time data refreshes, the Blue Night Vision Goggles force you to blink, which may be dangerous when near SCP-173. They use twice as much power as Night Vision Goggles.
