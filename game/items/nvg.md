# Night Vision Goggles
![nvg.png](/images/items/nvg.png =400x){.align-left}The Night Vision Goggles are an equippable item that can be found at Storage Area 6 and the Maintenance Tunnels. They can be used to see SCP-966 and to see better in dark areas. Night Vision Goggles require one 9V Battery to have power for approximately 6-7 minutes.

The Red Night Vision Goggles are an equippable item that can be obtained by putting Night Vision Goggles in SCP 914 “The Clockworks” on the setting “Fine”. These Night Vision Goggles have a red overlay and infinite amount of power.

The Blue Night Vision Goggles are an equippable item that can be obtained by putting Night Vision Goggles in SCP 914 “The Clockworks” on the setting “Very Fine”. These Night Vision Goggles have a blue overlay and provide users with approximate locations and distances of all humans and SCPs every 10 seconds. Each time data refreshes, the Blue Night Vision Goggles force you to blink, which may be dangerous when near SCP-173. They use twice as much power as Night Vision Goggles.
