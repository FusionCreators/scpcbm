# Class-D Orientation Leaflet

**Category**: `DOCUMENT`

The Class-D Orientation Leaflet is a document that can be found on the desk of D-9341's cell. It is supposed to describe to [D-Class Personnel](/en/game/jobs/dclass) what their designation is and what they are supposed to do.

Unlike what the leaflet says, [D-Class personnel](/en/game/jobs/dclass) will not be released at the end of the month.
