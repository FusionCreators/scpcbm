# Ballistic Vest

![vest.png](/items/ballisticvest/vest.png =250x){.align-right}**Name**: `Ballistic Vest`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`
The Ballistic Vest is an equippable item that can be found at the Omega Warhead Silo or inside of Dr. Maynard's office. It takes approximately 3 seconds to equip and is meant to protect the player's torso from bullets. Once it has been equipped, the player's turning speed will decrease. If the player gets shot in the torso, the vest will prevent blood loss and drastically lower the player's stamina. The player is still vulnerable to blood loss when shot in any other part of the body. When the player equips the vest, the following message appears: "You put on the vest and feel slightly encumbered".
