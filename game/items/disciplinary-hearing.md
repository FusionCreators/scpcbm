Disciplinary Hearing DH-S-4137-17092 is a document that can only be obtained from [SCP-1162](/en/game/scps/1162).

This document that's only available to the members of the O5 Council reveals that a Senior Researcher at Site ██ was charged with unauthorized research of a hypothetical anomalous phenomenon dubbed the "Spiral Gestalt".

When equipping the item for the first time, the following message appears: "Why does this seem so familiar?"

One of the following sounds will play as well:

<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer8.ogg"></audio>
<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer9.ogg"></audio>
<audio controls src="/audios/items/nostalgiacancer10.ogg"></audio>


Due to the nature of [SCP-1162](/en/game/scps/1162), and the fact that the [main character](/en/game/plot) finds it familiar, it is very likely that the senior researcher that's being charged with the offense is [Benjamin Oliver Walker](/en/game/plot). Following this disciplinary hearing, he was demoted to [Class-D Personnel](https://wiki.scpcbm.com/en/game/jobs/dclass).
