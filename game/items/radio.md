<audio controls src="/audios/radioalarm.ogg"></audio>

## Channel 3
This channel plays pre-recorded messages for foundation personnel, along with music in the background.

>"You're listening to SCP Foundation On-site Radio! Your 24/7 source for prerecorded messages."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio1.ogg"></audio>

>"A reminder, in the event of an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario, don't panic! It won't help. Nothing at all will help. However, panicking will help probably the least."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio2.ogg"></audio>

>"Report all suspect behaviour to your supervisors immediately. If you haven't noticed any unusual activity recently, you're not looking hard enough. A threat to security can originate from anywhere and no one is above suspicion. Not even you. Stay paranoid. Stay vigilant."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio3.ogg"></audio>

>"Should you hear a different voice announcing for SCP Foundation On-site Radio, disregard it entirely. He is not a foundation employee! He is trying to trick you and cannot be trusted. Any advice he gives can only inevitably lead to destruction, death, and utter chaos. You are immeasurably better off listening to me."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio4.ogg"></audio>

>"In the extremely unlikely event of a catastrophic power failure and subsequent facility-wide containment breach, just remember the crisis ABCs. A for Armaments. B for Blinking, come the lack of. And C for Cardiovascular fortitude. As they say, shoot, stare and sprint! Or feed the incoming monster one of your friends. Stay alive, stay vigilant."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio5.ogg"></audio>

>"Don't forget! Wednesday is pizza day! So head on down to the cafeteria and grab yourself a hot slice! -The SCP Foundation holds no liability for any injuries or illnesses sustained or contracted through the attendance of pizza day."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio7.ogg"></audio>

>"When dining at the facility cafeteria, always remember to check your ration for the deadly seven. Strychnine, Arsenic Trioxide, Nitrobenzene, Mercury, Epichlorohydrin, Acetone Thiosemicarbazone, and spiders. Stay healthy! Stay vigilant."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio8.ogg"></audio>

>"Every single thing he says is a lie. Every single one. Don't listen to him. You can trust me. I can get you out of this. I can get you away from all of this. Just listen to me."
<audio controls src="/audios/scpradio6.ogg"></audio>

>This music plays between the prerecorded messages.
<audio controls src="/audios/radio/scpradio0.ogg"></audio>

## Channel 4

This channel is reserved for communication during a containment breach. Nine Tailed Fox operatives and Security Chief Franklin can be heard talking on this channel.

>"Mobile Task Force unit Nine Tailed Fox is being prepped for entry. Hang in there, this will be over soon."
<audio controls src="/audios/franklin1.ogg"></audio>

>"To everyone still inside the facility: stay in the evacuation shelters. Do not try to make it to the exits no matter how close they are, the shelters are your best chance of making it through this."
<audio controls src="/audios/franklin2.ogg"></audio>

>"To everyone still hearing this: reality-bending events are common during containment breaches of this magnitude. Do not trust your senses. Do not trust anyone or anything."
<audio controls src="/audios/franklin3.ogg"></audio>

>"To everyone still hearing this: reality-bending events are common during containment breaches of this magnitude.. during containment breaches of this magnitude... [distorted] ...during containment breaches of this magnitude.. [further distorted] DO NOT TRUST YOUR SENSES."
<audio controls src="/audios/franklin4.ogg"></audio>

## Channel 5

On this channel, you can first hear someone getting taken to the pocket dimension by SCP 106. After that, you can hear multiple conversations between various foundation personnel.

>"Hello? Is anyone out there?....I don't know what-...I don't-...Oh god it's coming...Someone...Please anyone...Please...Someone needs to broadcast this station at once...Please...Oh god what is that?....What is that?
<audio controls src="/audios/ohgod.ogg"></audio>

>"Um, someone seems to have disabled the remote door control system."[^1]
<audio controls src="/audios/chatter3.ogg"></audio>


>Franklin: "This is Security Chief Franklin. Dr. Harp, do you copy?"
Harp: "This is Dr. Harp, I'm in the middle of something here, so please be quick."
"I believe that the incident report of 106's breach this morning is still on your computer."
Harp: "That's right, um, feel free to read it if you can reach my office."
Franklin: "We can just read the file from the facility Intranet, we'll need your personal access code to do that of course."
Harp: "Oh yeah well, mmm, sounds good, um, as I said I'm pretty busy now, we're giving the Mobile Task Force a li'l brief before sending them in. I'll get there and give you the code when we're done. Shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes."
Franklin: "I'm sorry but we need that file immediately. I understand it's against security protocol, but considering the circumstances, couldn't you just give me the code through the radio? At this point, I don't think the situation could become any worse no matter who's listening to us right now."
Harp: "Well, yeah, I-I think you're right, the code is 7-8-1-6."
Franklin: "Copy that."
<audio controls src="/audios/chatter2.ogg"></audio>

>Harp: "Dr. Maynard, please report in at Gate B."
Harp: "Um, Dr. Maynard, do you copy?"
"This is Agent Ulgrin sir, I'm afraid Dr. Maynard is still inside the facility."
Harp: "Oh, um, have you have any idea of his location or if he's still alive?"
"Negative, sir, all we know is that he hasn't made it out yet."
Harp: "Copy that, this place is such a goddamn maze and he has been working here only for a week, so it's no wonder he couldn't find his way out. Uh, I hope he's still hanging in there."
Harp: "I guess we'll find out when the Mobile Task Force goes in."
<audio controls src="/audios/chatter1.ogg"></audio>


>Harp: "Movement in Sector B."
Unknown: "Um, seems to be some Class D."
Harp: "Heh, I bet you fifty bucks that as he won't make it another five minutes."
