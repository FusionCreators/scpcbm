###### OMNI KEYCARD
![keycard6.png](/images/items/keycard6.png){.align-left}The Omni keycard is a blue and white keycard with no text in the  centre of the keycard unlike the levels 1 to 5 keycard and**can access anything requiring a keycard**, making it equivalent to a level 5 keycard. The **Omni keycard can only be obtained via placing a level 5 keycard into SCP-914** on the "Fine" setting or with any level keycard on the "Very Fine" setting, though this has a chance of creating a MasterCard instead.
