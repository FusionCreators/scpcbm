# S-NAV
The S-Nav 300 Navigator is a tool that can be used to better navigate through the facility. It can be found at Light Testing Chamber 2B and the archive room in the Light Containment Zone. It can be used in order to better navigate the facility. As you are walking through the facility, this device will draw a simple map of all rooms you have passed. It requires 9V Batteries to function. One battery is enough to power the navigator for approximately 4-5 minutes.

The S-Nav 310 Navigator can be made by putting an S-Nav 300 Navigator in SCP-914 “The Clockworks” on the setting “Fine”. This navigator displays the whole layout of the facility, regardless of whether you have been there or not.

The S-Nav Navigator Ultimate can be made by putting an S-Nav 300 Navigator or an S-Nav 310 Navigator in SCP-914 “The Clockworks” on the setting “Very Fine”. It’s similar to an S-Nav 310 Navigator, although it has infinite power and now displays locations of nearby SCPs, with SCP-966 being an exception.
