![mastercard.png](/images/items/mastercard.png){.align-right}**Name**: `Mastercard`
**Category**: `UNEQUIPPABLE`

The Mastercard is an unequippable item that can be obtained by putting any [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) inside of [SCP-914 "The Clockworks"](/en/game/scps/914) on the setting "Very Fine", by putting a level 1, 2 or 4 [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) on the setting "Fine" or by putting an Omni [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) on the setting "1:1". They can not be used for anything in the game, except for being upgraded in [SCP-914](/en/game/scps/914).

Putting a Mastercard on the setting "Coarse" will result in 4 [quarters](/en/game/items/quarter) that can be upgraded to [keycards](/en/game/items/Keycards).

Putting a Mastercard on the setting "1:1" will result in a level 1 [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards).

Putting a Mastercard on the setting "Fine" or "Very Fine" will result in a level 2 [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards).
