# Hazmat Suit

![hazmatsuit.png](/images/items/hazmatsuit.png =160x){.align-right}**Name**: `Hazmat Suit`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`

The Hazmat Suit is an equippable item that can only be found at SCP-008's containment chamber. It takes approximately 5,7 seconds to equip. It's meant to protect the player from harmful effects of [SCP-008](https://wiki.scpcbm.com/en/game/scps/008). While in the Hazmat Suit, the player is unable to drop, pick up or use any other items, with weapons being an exception. If a weapon was equipped before putting on the Hazmat Suit, the player will be able to use that weapon. It can also be used to prevent SCP-049 from killing the player. The screen will shake 3 times, after which SCP-049 will kill you.[^1]

# Fine/Very Fine Hazmat Suit
**Name**: `Fine/Very Fine Hazmat Suit`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`

The Fine/Very Fine Hazmat Suit can be obtained by putting the Hazmat Suit inside of SCP-914 "The Clockworks" on the setting "Fine" or "Very Fine". The Fine/Very Hazmat Suit is identical to the Hazmat Suit, although the wearer will receive infinite stamina while wearing it.

# Heavy Hazmat Suit
**Name**: `Heavy Hazmat Suit`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`

The Heavy Hazmat Suit can be obtained by putting the Hazmat Suit inside of SCP-914 "The Clockworks" along with an SCP-148 ingot on the setting "Fine" or "Very Fine". This Hazmat Suit protects from the effects of SCP-895, SCP-012 and SCP-035's tentacle-like appendages. When SCP-049 touches a player wearing the Heavy Hazmat Suit, their vision will get blurry, but SCP-049 will not kill them.

[^1]:If SCP-049 touches you with your hazmat suit, he will say the following: "Let's get this strange garment, out of the way."
