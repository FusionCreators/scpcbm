# Clipboard
In the game “SCP - Containment Breach”, the clipboard is an equippable item that can be found in the storeroom and sometimes in the archive room. It can be used to store certain items within itself.

Storage: The clipboard can be used to store documents, notes, master cards, access keycards and Emily Ross’ badge. It can only hold up to 10 items at once. This is helpful during gameplay, because the player might not have any place left in his inventory for less useful items.

SCP 914: The clipboard can be put in SCP-914, otherwise known as “The Clockworks” in various settings, although this won’t result in the clipboard changing whatsoever

In conclusion, the clipboard is only useful for storing spare access keycards and information on various SCP objects, as well as notes and other documents.
