# SCP-714

**Name**: `SCP-714`
**Category**: `EQUIPPABLE`

SCP-714 is an equippable item that can be found in the [Light Containment Zone](/en/game/rooms/lcz), inside of it's respective containment chamber. While equipped, the player's stamina will drop to only 2 bars. However, wearing it can protect the player from harmful effects of [SCP-012](/en/game/scps/012), [SCP-895](/en/game/rooms/895), [SCP-1025](/en/game/scps/1025) and [SCP-049](/en/game/scps/049). It is important to note that it does not permanently protect from [SCP-049](/en/game/scps/049).
