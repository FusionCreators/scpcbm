# The Modular Site Project
![msp.jpg](/images/items/msp.jpg =400x){.align-right}**Name**: `The Modular Site Project`
**Category**: `DOCUMENT`

The Modular Site Project is a document that can be found on a desk in the Conference Room 9B in the [Entrance Zone](/en/game/rooms/ent).

This document reveals that the O5 Council has approved the Modular Site Project, a concept initiated by Doctor George Maynard and the Engineering and Technical Service Department. Site-██ was able to contain many SCPs in a short time period, despite being only a research and development oriented facility, using this concept. It is most likely the reason why ventilation shafts are bigger than usual, and the reason why Site-██ looks like a maze.

It is speculated that Doctor George Maynard initiated this concept to make extraction and recovery harder in the event of a containment breach.
