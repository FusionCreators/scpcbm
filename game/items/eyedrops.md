ReVision Eyedrops are a small, blue bottle that, when used, will slow down the blink meter for a short period of time. They can be used most effectively when encountering SCP-173. By putting it through SCP-914 on the "1:1" setting, the player will obtain ReVision Eyedrops with a red label, titled "RedVision Eyedrops". However, it is to be noted that no form of eyedrops will work while wearing SCP-714. They also cannot be used whilst wearing a gas mask or a hazmat suit.

### Eyedrops
The eyedrops are obtained by putting the ReVision Eyedrops through SCP-914 on the "Fine" or "Very Fine" setting. The resulting item from converting it on "Fine" or "Very Fine" setting have different effects. "Fine" eyedrops will slow down the blink meter for a longer period of time and alleviate some of the player's blood loss. "Very Fine" eyedrops will cause the player to stop blinking entirely for a prolonged period of time. However, the player's vision will become blurry over time until the player becomes completely blind for a set period of time, which can be dangerous when near SCP-173.
