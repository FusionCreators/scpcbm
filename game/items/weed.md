# SCP-420-J

**Category**: `Smokeable`
SCP-420-J, known as "The Best ████ in the World", is a Safe-class joke object that can be found in the head office, which requires a [level 4](/en/game/items/Keycards) or higher keycard to enter. Two joints of SCP-420-J can be found on the table in the room along with a document and a readable screen in the room. Entitled "Some SCP-420-J", using the item will cause the file Mandeville.ogg to play, a slight "blur" when the player moves, and a text to appear at the bottom of the screen saying, "MAN DATS SUM GOOD ASS SHIT", presumably said by the player. If the player is wearing SCP-714, SCP-420-J will have no effect prompting the text to appear as, "DUDE WTF THIS SHIT DOESN'T EVEN WORK". SCP-420-J can also cure the nausea brought on by the strange bottle and heal injuries.
## SCP-914
Putting SCP-420-J through [SCP-914](/en/game/mechanics/914) will give the player a number of alternates from it, the exact form depending on which setting that SCP-914 is turned to. Putting SCP-914 on "1:1" will result in a cigarette, which will disappear when used and cause one of a few different messages to appear. Putting it on "Fine" will result in a joint and "Very Fine" will result in a smelly joint, and, if either is consumed, it will kill the player. A message is also shown that reads, "UH WHERE... WHAT WAS I DOING AGAIN... MAN I NEED TO TAKE A NAP...".
