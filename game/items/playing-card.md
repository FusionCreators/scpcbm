# Playing Card
![playingcard.png](/images/items/playingcard.png){.align-right}**Name**: `Playing Card`
**Category**: `UNEQUIPPABLE`

The Playing Card is an unequippable item that can be obtained by putting any [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards) inside of the input booth of [SCP-914 "The Clockworks"](/en/game/scps/914) on the setting "1:1" or by putting a level 3 keycard in the input booth on the setting "Fine".

It serves no purpose in the game, other than having the ability to be upgraded to better items inside of [SCP-914 "The Clockworks"](/en/game/scps/914).

Putting it in on the setting "1:1" will result in a level 1 [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards).
Putting it in on the setting "Fine" and "Very Fine" will result in a level 2 [keycard](/en/game/items/Keycards).
