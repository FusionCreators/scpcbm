## SCP-035

SCP-035, also known as "The Possessive Mask," is a significant and dangerous anomaly within the SCP Foundation's database in the fictional universe of SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect). SCP-035 is a mask with several anomalous properties, and it's classified as Keter, indicating it is a highly dangerous and difficult-to-contain SCP.
1.Possession: SCP-035 has the ability to possess and control the bodies of living beings, primarily humans. When someone wears the mask, they become the host for SCP-035. The mask appears to gain control over the host's body, forcing them to carry out its will.

2.Manipulation: SCP-035 is highly manipulative and can use its host to deceive and manipulate others into freeing it or carrying out various actions on its behalf.

3.Corrupting Influence: SCP-035 has a corrupting and malevolent influence on its hosts, often leading them to commit violent and dangerous acts.

4.Containment: The containment procedures for SCP-035 involve keeping it in a hermetically sealed glass case to prevent its escape and contact with any personnel. Extreme care is taken when handling the mask to prevent accidental possession.

5. In the SCP Foundation universe, it's imperative to keep SCP-035 securely contained due to its dangerous abilities and manipulative nature. Its presence in the database signifies the need for constant vigilance and stringent containment measures to prevent any potential breaches or incidents.
