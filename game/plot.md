# Plot
## pre game events
After multiple ![docir106.webp](/images/documents/docir106.webp =375x){.align-left}   SCP Foundation's facilities {.align-right} and sectors were attacked by the Chaos insurgency, the SCP Foundation relocated a portion of escaped SCPs to Site-██, in which the game takes place.

 Undercover agents from the Chaos Insurgency are responsible for the massive containment breach at Site-██, most notable being Agent Skinner and Dr. Maynard. 

On an undisclosed date at 9:00 AM, Agent Skinner and Agent Carey started their morning shift at SCP 106's containment chamber. After Agent Carey went to get coffee from Cafeteria B, Agent Skinner released SCP 106 and notified Dr. Maynard via the S-Com Software. Dr. Maynard then proceeded to SCP 079's containment chamber and gave SCP 079 control over every major system inside of Site-██ while the security team was busy dealing with recontainment of SCP 106. Dr. Maynard was most likely sent to the pocket dimension by SCP 106 in a hallway outside SCP 079's containment chamber.

 When the breach was dealt with, and cleaning crews were dispatched to fix damage caused by SCP 106, Researcher Ferguson noticed that the blast door leading to SCP 079 can not be opened manually or via the control panel.

 A team of three technicians was sent to check the door. After concluding that the problem is not caused by a fault in the door control system, they started disassembling the door. Soon after this, SCP 079 opened the majority of containment chamber's in the facility, causing a major containment breach.

## Audio
- "For some reason, he passed by 079's chamber, and now the doors aren't working."
[indecipherable]

- "Well, at least they weren't working when I last passed by."
[indecipherable]

- "Skinner?"
[indecipherable]

- "Hmm, I don't recall knowing him. Was he ever stationed at this sector?"
[indecipherable]

- "Yeah, he picked up a security agent and a junior researcher on the way."
[indecipherable]

- "Kid was taking papers to his supervisor. Shit sucks."
[indecipherable]

- "It shook up Dr. L. pretty badly. He hasn't left his office, says he's been hearing things."
[indecipherable]

### After The breach
- Attention, all personnel, report to Gate [distortion] ...immediately.

## Endings
Currently, there are 4 endings that the player can reach. Each ending plays a unique audio recording or radio transmission on the end screen between personnel discussing events that took place after the game ended.

## Gate A
If D-9341 does not contain SCP-106 upon entering Gate A, SCP-106 will attempt to break out of the facility at Gate A, but will be shot by the H.I.D. Turret, forcing it to retreat to its Pocket Dimension. D-9341 will be forced to take the stairs on the left side of the exit while this is happening, as there are several MTF units and apaches deployed around the area that will be distracted by SCP-106 until it retreats. Upon taking the stairs downwards, D-9341 will find a door that leads to a service tunnel. At the same time several MTF units will spot D-9341 and pursue him into the tunnel.

Upon getting halfway through the tunnel, three Chaos Insurgency operatives warp in front of D-9341, telling him that they know too much to be killed. The soldiers will then warp him away and collapse the tunnel on a set of MTF units entering it, trapping them inside. It is unknown as to what the Chaos Insurgency plans to do with D-9341.

## Ending Audio

- "Sir, we're having a major problem here."
- "Please elaborate. Has the target been captured yet?"
- "I'm not sure what's happening here. We entered the old service tunnel and it sorta…closed up on us. Now we're trapped inside. Sanders is dead. Target's been lost."
- "Are you saying that the tunnel collapsed on you?"
- "No! It didn't collapse. It seemed like an anomalous event. Come see for yourself, and send someone to get us out of here!"

<audio controls src="/audios/dialogue/tunnel.mp3"></audio>

## Gate A-2
If D-9341 contains SCP-106 before exiting through Gate A, then the MTF units will immediately engage him and command him to halt, before announcing they have found a Class-D. After being taken by the MTF units, the game will then end.

The end screen plays a recording of a testing log in which a scientist discusses D-9341. It mentions D-9341's ability to predict and overcome hazardous threats that the containment breach produced. The log concludes with the scientist mentioning that classification of D-9341 as an SCP subject is being considered.

## Ending Audio
"Testing log ███. Subject █-████. Subject demonstrates extraordinary luck and complete mastery of even the most fatal of circumstances and an uncanny ability to predict even the most unpredictable of hazards, almost as if it has performed these impossible tasks several times before. Further testing is required to determine whether the subject should receive SCP classification."

![gate-a-gmod.jpg](/images/rooms/gate-a-gmod.jpg)

## Gate B
Upon entering Gate B, a voice over the intercom will announce that SCP-682 has broken out of the facility in that area and that they will be detonating the alpha warheads in 90 seconds.

If D-9341 has not turned off the Alpha Warheads in the Warhead Silo before he reaches Gate B, a siren will sound and a bright flash from the warhead's explosion will cover the screen at the end of the countdown. D-9341 dies in the explosion.

The end screen plays a radio transmission of an operative from helicopter OH-6 requesting the deployment of an MTF unit to scout for remains at ground zero. However, the transmission is cut-off mid sentence as a large roar is heard, indicating that the nuclear blast was unsuccessful in destroying SCP-682.

## Ending Audio
- "This is CH-1 to OH-6 have you located the target, over?"
- "OH-6 to CH-1, no sign of the target. I think we should send an MTF-[another voice is heard  
   yelling "Incoming!", followed by SCP-682's roar.]"
- "CH-1 to OH-6 do you copy?"

<audio controls src="/audios/dialogue/endingb2.mp3"></audio>

 ## Gate B-2
If D-9341 has turned off the Alpha Warheads in the Warhead Silo, the nuclear detonation will not occur and the intercom will order all MTF units to head back to the gate to handle SCP-682. Following the announcement, an unidentified MTF group (presumably Cloud Nine), or another Apache will locate D-9341 and terminate them, ending the game with a transmission clarifying that a stray Class-D has been terminated.

## Ending Audio
- "Sir, we found a dead Class-D on the walkway outside Gate B. He's got multiple gun shot wounds in his chest. I'd assume he was shot when we were fighting SCP-682."
- "I'd like to know how the hell did a Class-D get past the gate. Deliver me the security tapes from all the cameras near the gate and find out who was stationed there, before and during 682's escape attempt."
- "Roger that sir."

## After event

It is unknown as to what happens after any of the endings, but judging by the fact that quotes from personnel who are cleaning up the facility are seen whenever the player dies, it is assumed that the containment breach was eventually resolved.

In the second ending at Gate A, it is safe to asume the scientist is referring to the players ability to respawn. This will most likely result with the player obtaining a SCP status, although it is unknown how/if he will be contained.

## Others
It's really scary to think that in a situation like this, your chances of survival would be one in a million. ~ Zav
