## Endings
Currently, there are 4 endings that the player can reach. Each ending plays a unique audio recording or radio transmission on the end screen between personnel discussing events that took place after the game ended.

Gate A
If D-9341 does not contain SCP-106 upon entering Gate A, SCP-106 will attempt to break out of the facility at Gate A, but will be shot by the H.I.D. Turret, forcing it to retreat to its Pocket Dimension. D-9341 will be forced to take the stairs on the left side of the exit while this is happening, as there are several MTF units and apaches deployed around the area that will be distracted by SCP-106 until it retreats. Upon taking the stairs downwards, D-9341 will find a door that leads to a service tunnel. At the same time several MTF units will spot D-9341 and pursue him into the tunnel.

Upon getting halfway through the tunnel, three Chaos Insurgency operatives warp in front of D-9341, telling him that they know too much to be killed. The soldiers will then warp him away and collapse the tunnel on a set of MTF units entering it, trapping them inside. It is unknown as to what the Chaos Insurgency plans to do with D-9341.

## Ending Audio

- "Sir, we're having a major problem here."
- "Please elaborate. Has the target been captured yet?"
- "I'm not sure what's happening here. We entered the old service tunnel and it sorta…closed up on us. Now we're trapped inside. Sanders is dead. Target's been lost."
- "Are you saying that the tunnel collapsed on you?"
- "No! It didn't collapse. It seemed like an anomalous event. Come see for yourself, and send someone to get us out of here!"
