- Exploration: The game is set in a procedurally generated facility with various rooms, hallways, and containment chambers. You must explore to find key items and progress through the game.

- Inventory: You can carry items in your inventory, such as key cards, batteries, and first aid kits. These items are crucial for progressing and surviving encounters with SCPs.

- SCP Objects: The facility contains various SCP objects, each with unique and dangerous properties. Some SCPs, like SCP-173 (the "Peanut"), will attack you if you break eye contact, while others may cause hallucinations or mind-affecting effects.

- Blink Mechanic: To survive encounters with SCP-173, you must periodically blink. If you don't blink, SCP-173 will move closer to you. This adds tension and an element of timing to the gameplay.

- Key Cards: Key cards are essential for accessing different areas of the facility. You must find or steal key cards from dead personnel or storage areas.

- Health and Stamina: Your character has limited health and stamina. You must manage these resources, avoid dangerous situations, and heal yourself when injured.

- Saving: SCP: CB uses manual saving. You must find save points throughout the facility, making saving your progress a strategic decision.

- Security Personnel: The facility is also guarded by armed security personnel who are under orders to contain breaches. You must avoid them or find ways to incapacitate them to progress.

- Puzzles and Objectives: To escape, you'll need to solve puzzles and complete specific objectives. These can involve finding specific items, accessing locked areas, or interacting with various objects.

- Random Events: SCP: CB features random events and scripted sequences that can catch you off guard and increase the game's tension.

- Permadeath: If your character dies, you'll need to reload a previous save, which makes death a significant setback.

- Atmosphere and Horror: The game is known for its dark and eerie atmosphere, jump scares, and psychological horror elements. It relies heavily on building tension and fear.

- SCP: CB is a challenging and frightening game that relies on exploration, resource management, and the avoidance of deadly SCPs. It has gained a strong following in the SCP community and horror game enthusiasts for its unique take on the SCP Foundation lore.
