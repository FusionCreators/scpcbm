**Detailed description**: It is usually found attached to the walls of deep caves. It can be either picked up or harvested for Gel Sack Spores by using a Knife. A Gel Sack gives one Spore per knife strike. Up to three Spores can be collected from a single Gel Sack in this way, with the Sack being destroyed by the third strike. Extracting Spores from a Gel Sack has no effect on its qualities as a raw material or food source if it is picked up. There is a bug using this, as hitting it with a knife twice, putting it in the inventory, and hitting it again will give you infinite amount of spores.

Either item can be planted in an Exterior Growbed. It is a good idea to establish a growbed for gel sacks, as Aerogel is used in several high-end recipes and the plants are fairly rare outside of deep regions.

Gel Sacks are unique among edible flora species in that they do not rot while in the player's inventory, making them a viable food and water source for longer trips, but they do not provide much food or water individually. However, they only occupy a single spot in the player's inventory, allowing for many to be carried at once.
