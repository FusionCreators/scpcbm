## Lore

In the SCP Foundation universe, the Nine-Tailed Fox, also known as Mobile Task Force Lambda-4 (nicknamed "The Desert Foxes"), is a specialized task force responsible for the containment and control of anomalous entities and situations. While not necessarily a supernatural or mythical creature like the traditional nine-tailed fox from folklore, this term is used as a code name for the task force. The Foundation often uses such code names to maintain security and secrecy.

The Nine-Tailed Fox is a highly trained and well-equipped force, primarily dealing with the retrieval and containment of Euclid and Keter-class SCP objects, as well as responding to containment breaches. Their members are selected from various military, paramilitary,and security organizations and undergo rigorous training to handle paranormal threats.
