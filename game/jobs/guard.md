# Guard
**Name**: `Guard`
**Category**: `SCP Foundation`
**Health**: `120`
**Items**: `FN-P90/MP5-SD, USP Pistol, Level 5 Key Card, Handcuffs, Radio`
## Lore 
The Guards are the protectors of the SCP Foundation's facilities and make sure the facility is guarded at all cost. They are ordered to guard scientists and escort Class-Ds to their contaiment chambers and cells and they also are ordered to keep watch over SCPs.
## In Game
Guards are spawned at either Gate A or Gate B when the contaiment breach has started. They are ordered to gather any surviving scientists that they can find during the contaiment breach.

When going to the other zones, the guards will need to be on constant watch on nearby SCPs, in order to survive successfully.
