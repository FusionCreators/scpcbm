## Lore
SCP-049 is a tall figure standing at 1.9 meters (approximately 6 feet 3 inches) in height. It wears a black robe, a traditional plague doctor's mask, and leather gloves. SCP-049 speaks in a refined and articulate manner, suggesting intelligence and a deep understanding of medical practices. The entity also carries a black satchel containing a variety of medical instruments, which it uses for its "treatments."SCP-049 claims to be a doctor, with its primary goal being the "treatment" of individuals it believes are infected with a pestilence that it refers to as the "Great Pestilence." It does so by attempting to perform surgeries and procedures on its subjects, which often result in the death of the patient.SCP-049 has displayed the ability to reanimate deceased bodies, referred to as "SCP-049-2 instances." These reanimated entities are typically in a zombie-like state and will follow SCP-049's orders. SCP-049 believes that it is "curing" people by reanimating them in this manner.The true origins of SCP-049 remain shrouded in mystery. The entity appears to possess knowledge of medieval medical practices and the concept of "The Pestilence," which it believes plagues humanity. The SCP Foundation has been unable to verify its claims about this pestilence.
