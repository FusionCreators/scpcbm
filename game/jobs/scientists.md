**Name**: `Scientist`
**Category**: `SCP Foundation`
**Health**: `100`
**Items**: `Level 2 Key Card`
## Lore
Scientists are what gives the SCP Foundation purpose by researching, developing counter measures when a contaiment breach occurs, and making various devices and medicine.

Scientists may have certain Key Cards depending on how skilled they are. The Key Cards define to a Scientist that they can handle a certain SCP level: a level 3 card can open most Euclid SCP types (966, 079, etc) and a level 4 card can open most Keter SCP types (049, 106, etc).

## In Game

During the game, Scientists have the goal to escape the facility as soon as possible, and will be provided extra assistance when MTF arrive to the facility.

With having a Key Card handy, Scientists have the advantage to open SCP-914 (Which can be used to upgrading your Key Card) and open heavy containment almost immediately.
