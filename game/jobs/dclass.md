![items.png](/images/roles/imageedit_1_4230581360.png)
**Name**: `D-Class`
**Category**: `D-Class/Chaos`
**Health**: `100`
**Items**: `None`
## Lore
Before, they were death row inmates, now D-Class that are used for experimental tests for SCPs. The D-Class first take amnestics when going to the SCP Foundation to lose their past experiences, which helps the SCP Foundation worry less about what they might do to escape or other deviant choices. 
## In Game
D-Class during the game, have the goal to escape the facility while being provided with no items, and they must find a way to get keycards or use weapons to snatch keycards from other roles, such as a janitor would be the easiest to steal from. 

When you are approaching to the end of entrance zone as D-Class, the best way to escape would be to go to Gate A with the Chaos to become one yourself, rather than Gate B, because that is where the MTF are and are ordered to shoot you on sight.
