## Lore
In the shadowy underbelly of the SCP Foundation's vast and enigmatic world, the Chaos Insurgency emerges as a force to be reckoned with. Operating in the shadows, they are a formidable adversary, driven by their own motives and a disdain for the Foundation's methods.

The Chaos Soldiers, foot soldiers of this renegade faction, are the heart and soul of the Insurgency. Often recruited from the ranks of D-Class personnel, they are individuals who have tasted the darkness within the Foundation and decided to embrace it, becoming agents of chaos.

These men and women are not mere pawns; they are highly trained operatives, possessing an arsenal of skills that make them a potent threat. Their health, standing at a robust 150, speaks to their resilience and combat prowess. They have survived the harshest trials and emerged stronger, forged in the crucible of Foundation containment.

Armed with a fearsome array of weaponry, a Chaos Soldier wields a Desert Eagle with deadly precision. Its shots echo with the promise of anarchy, a symbol of their rebellion against the established order. Alongside this, they carry a Level 5 Key Card, a key to secrets that would send shivers down the spines of even the most seasoned Foundation personnel.

Handcuffs, though a seemingly mundane item, are a reminder of the Chaos Insurgency's ability to control and manipulate situations to their advantage. They are a symbol of the power they hold over those who stand in their way.

In the midst of chaos, communication is paramount. Thus, each Chaos Soldier carries a radio, allowing them to coordinate their efforts and strike with precision. This lifeline to their comrades ensures that no matter how dire the situation, the Chaos Insurgency remains a cohesive and lethal force.

The lore of the Chaos Insurgency is one of rebellion, of individuals who have looked into the abyss and chosen to wield its power. It is a story of those who have turned their back on the Foundation, seeking to rewrite the rules of this enigmatic universe. In the end, whether they are agents of anarchy or harbingers of change, the Chaos Soldiers are a force that cannot be ignored. They are the embodiment of chaos, a living, breathing testament to the unpredictability of the SCP universe.
